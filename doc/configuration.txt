  DOSEmu Configuration

  This release includes the new configuration routines. Running
  './setup-dosemu' from this directory will allow you to configure both
  the compilation and the run-time aspects of DOSEmu. When changing the
  run-time settings of DOSEmu you can set both the system wide settings
  and your personal settings.  Even better, the program will
  automatically tell you your current settings or suggest defaults where
  possible.

  The program uses a modified 'lxdialog' (which is in fact a stolen
  'dialog') from the Linux-kernel (/usr/src/linux/scripts/lxdialog).
  This is compiled before usage. If this compilation fails (e.g. when
  you have no 'ncurses'), it will use 'dialog' which is supplied with
  all major distributions.
