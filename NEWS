dosemu2-alpha1

Well, there are ~2650 commits since the last pre-alpha release (pre8)
so tagging is a due. Initially I wanted to keep the alpha stage entirely
in git, but it simply doesn't work that way. Seems better to release
alpha software than nothing at all. :) Note that this is a quite late
alpha, i.e. we implemented most of the core parts of dosemu2. So this
alpha reflects the final dosemu2 architecture quite strongly, and yet
there are lots more work to do...

Summary of changes:
* Use fdpp as our boot OS. fdpp is a 64bit DOS core that boots under
  dosemu2 and allows to work without installing any DOS. Of course
  you can still install any DOS if you want.
* Use comcom32 as our shell. comcom32 is a command.com variant that
  runs in 32bit space. Eventually we aim for the 64bit shell, but so
  far we only have this. You can still use your favourite shell if you
  want.
* Worked out the security model. We hope that dosemu2 now provides
  a relatively secure sandbox environment, and yet exposes all the
  needed features. Exposing features in a secure manner (rather than
  to simply declare them insecure and disable) was a challenge.
* Add KVM-assisted acceleration to DPMI.
* Implemented region locking and share support in MFS. One of the
  most requested/missed feature of dosemu1 times.

Version dosemu2-2.0pre8
=============
We have ~300 commits, many of which are bug-fixing, as pre7 was horribly
buggy due to heavy development. As for the newly introduced regressions -
not too much known at this time, except the drop of clang support. We
hope to get clang support back again in the very near future.

Summary of changes:
* Improved hx-extender support so that the win32 version of quake2
  can now work under dosemu2 (in pre7 it was supposed to but didn't).
* Support for external EMS managers like emm286.exe was (partially)
  implemented. As the result, we have a new UMB driver, umb.sys, that
  allows to enable UMB without also enabling EMS, leaving this possibility
  to an external driver.
* New DOSes supported: RxDOS 7.1.x and 7.2, PC-MOS 5.01.
* fossil driver got updates and missing functionality additions.
* Sound stack got updates to reduce the latencies.
* Passing DOS commands via dosemu's cmdline was changed, see man for
  details. Many new possibilities added, like passing environment
  variables and more.
* Some no longer used commands (comline.com, ecpuon.com, ecpuoff.com)
  were removed.
* Dumb terminal mode now handles the charsets.
* Fixes to all regression bugs of pre7 - there were many of them.

Version dosemu2-2.0pre7
=============
We have over 700 commits, mostly targeted on re-introducing and fixing
the features previously supported in dosemu1, and a couple of new ones.
Unfortunately we also have a few regressions.
Summary below.

* Reworks to SDL plugin. The HW-accelerated rendering is now disabled
  by default, as well as the scaling filters, and full-screen switching
  may not work. If you want to use HW-accelerated rendering, try
  $_SDL_swrend = (off). If you want scaling filters or full-screen, use
  'dosemu -X'. We will try to improve the SDL support in future releases.
* HX extender now fully supported, quake2 works!
* Mouse wheel support implemented
* Support booting OpenDOS and some old versions of MS-DOS.
* 2 new keyboard plugins implemented ("stdio" and "tty") to allow dumb
  terminal mode to work without slang library. Selectable with '-kt', '-ks'.
* VGA pass-through in text-mode console is now fully supported. Hope
  no one uses it though.
* Windows-3.1 support is fully re-introduced, and is actually much better
  than in dosemu1. We also provide the mouse driver for windows-3.1 that
  allows the use of the host's mouse pointer:
  https://github.com/stsp/win31-mouse-driver/tree/master/out
* Resurrected basic Windows-3.0 support.
* Foxpro support re-introduced.
* Fixes to SVGA/VESA modes. Support for some missing modes added.
* Many fixes to gfx remapper. The various annoying video artifacts
  should now be fixed.
* SB16 fixes to support sound on more games.
* Mouse copy/paste support is fully re-introduced.
* New $_bootdrive option allows to boot from any drive, not only C.
* Net: IPX and packet driver are fully functional again.
* Lots of build system improvements. We have now the debian build support
  and "make uninstall".
* X fonts are resurrected and provided again.
* Many fixes and improvements: DPMI support is now much more reliable,
  x86 JIT is more reliable, many performance improvements.
* Many updates to interrupt routing code.
* Resurrected emufs.sys.
* Sanitize syntax of lredir2: silly LINUX\FS is no longer needed.

Version dosemu2-2.0pre6
=============
We have around 500 commits since pre5 with the highlights below:

* KVM is now enabled by default on 64bit builds. A huge speed-up!
* SDL plugin now uses hardware-accelerated texture updates instead
  of the (slow) drawing surface
* virtual modem support is added
* serial port fifos now work again (were broken/unsupported in dosemu2
    but worked in dosemu1)
* DPMI context switching is rewritten for speed-up, using a new
  linux kernel extensions and the code from libtask and libpcl
* default DPMI memory size enlarged to 128Mb, which is enough for
  all known DOS programs
* new builtin command system.com is added that runs DOS commands
  specified via the unix env vars. Similar functionality in unix.com
  is kept for compatibility.
* DOSDRIVE_D var is removed. Use new DOSDRIVE_EXTRA variable.
* mouse driver got a huge overhaul for improved robustness in non-grab mode
* winos2 mouse extension is implemented for better support of the OS/2
  mouse driver under windows-3.1
* middle mouse button is now supported (was broken)
* dosdebug fixes
* many fixes to SDL plugin
* the home dir is no longer exposed to DOS by default. Use -home if you
  need this.
* added -cdrom option that tries to mount the cdrom and expose it to DOS
* $_hdimage option can now embed environment variables
* many performance bottlenecks were located and fixed
* many fixes and updates

and to Julius Schwartzenberg and @bolle732 for continuous testing.


Version dosemu2-2.0pre5
=============
* SDL video backend is now default, which means a GPU-accelerated rendering
* lredir command was deprecated, use lredir2 with the new syntax
* unix.com syntax was slightly changed
* new tool sound.com is added to change sound and MIDI parameters at run-time
* LPT2 is now pre-configured to print to PDF files
* Added preliminary support for old MS-DOSes (>=3.3) and some DR-DOSes
* many improvements to dosdebug
* use logarithmic volume scale for sound
* Preliminary KVM support - a very fast execution on 64bit machines.
  Should be manually enabled in config for now.
* Many regressions fixed
* Added valgrind support, which allowed to find many obscure bugs
* Work-arounds to support the newer fluidsynth for MIDI
* More versions of libao are supported for sound (each having its own bugs).
  This is good when SDL2 is unavailable.
* munt support for mt32 (you need to download Roland ROMs yourself)
* built-in backtracer is added for a better crash logs.
  Used if gdb is not installed.
* clang is now supported to compile dosemu2
