97/11/22 ver. 0.67.16 released
	From Eric
	- found and fixed a diabolic memory overwriting bug
	  ( src/base/dev/dma/dma.c, loop limit was 5 instead of 4)
	From Hans
	- new DOSEMU detection stuff (without even trying to INTE6)
	  (all *.S -> *.com converted to that)
	  ... to be continued
	- to reduce confusion: ./configure becomes ./base-configure
	- new script 'mkconfscript', which is used to build proper
	  configure scripts (runs autoconf, autoheader and replaces
	  /bin/sh with /bin/bash)
97/11/20 ver. 0.67.15.1 unofficial pre-release
	From Marcus Better <Marcus.Better@abc.se>
	- INT13-Support for more than 1024 cylinders
	  (bit6..7 of DH building 12 bit cylinder number)
	- INT13 IBM/MS Extensions, AH=41h-44h and 47h-48h.
	  This uses 64-bit logical block numbers. It's documented in
	  the R.Browns Interrupt List.
	From Hans
	- Making Marcus' INT13-4096 cylinder mode a dosemu.conf option,
	  such that nothing old could break.
	  Flag for the disk statement: diskcyl4096
	- docs rebuild
97/11/07 ver. 0.67.15 released
	From Alberto
	- replace all error("ERROR...) with error("...), because ERROR is
	  already prefixed in function error().
	From Hans
	- fixed 'error()' such that 'error("@xyz...")' will print _without_
	  prefixing 'ERROR:'. (print_exception_info() was printing wrong).
97/11/07 ver. 0.67.14.2 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- make USING_NET a configuration option
	- fixes to lt-threads (atomic_* name clashes, locking stuff)
	- make some compiler warnings go away
	From Hans
	- small fix for configure.in not detecting correctly broken textutils.
	- introduced  --enable-experimental to avoid playing JoeUser with
	  not yet working stuff.
	- syncing lt-threads with my and Albertos changes (and vice versa)
	  Version now 0.4.2
	- DANG and docs recompile
97/11/01 ver. 0.67.14.1 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- BIG patch to introduce the willows twin based cpu emulator
	  ( too much to describe the details here, have a look at 
	  src/doc/README/cpuemu). Alberto did a great job in porting the twin
	  cpu emulator to DOSEMU! We hope that one day (a) DOSEMU can run
	  on machines other then the Intel and (b) we can use the emulator
	  to simulate ring0 protected mode (win95;-).
	  However, currently its _very_ experimental and only few programms
	  run, hence it is disabled by default. As it now is in the
	  distribution we can make efforts to get this baby on its way;-)
	- cleanup for the old X86_EMULATOR define (now using it for cpuemu)
	- small initial documentation
	From Hans
	- doing the 'slave work' of integrating Alberto's patch ;-)
	  ( including copyright verification with Willows )
	- new dosemu.conf options: 'cpu emulated' and 'logfilesize xxx'
	- reworked log_printf and 'error', now both are functions and call
	  'vlog_printf'. This avoids recursive macro expansion, when
	  redirecting 'fprintf' to 'error' in the twin code.
	- making dosdebug to tell us wether we are on a simulated cpu.
97/10/24 ver. 0.67.14 released
	From Alberto
	- prep for cpuemu in src/arch/linux/debugger/{dis8086.c,mhpdbgc.c}
	- isolated log-printf stuff in headers to avoid name clashes for
	  cpuemu: new file src/include/dosemu_debug.h
	- fixed bug/typo in src/include/vgaemu.h: vga_emu_fault was passing
	  wrong arg.
	From Hans
	- adapted DANG_CONF, DANG and docs recompile
97/10/23 ver. 0.67.13.2 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- fix for Matrox _and_ 'speaker non-native', lots of port61 fixes.
	- fixed bugs in dpmi.c (LWORD was used instead of _LWORD)
	- replaced [rep]{in,out}s{bwd} in vm86.c and dpmi.c with calls
	  to a common set of functions in n_ports.c.
	- completed prefix handling for ports stuff, all combinations now
	  are considered.
	- aligned some (lot of) code to the Bitxxx type convention.
97/10/22 ver. 0.67.13.1 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- rest of ioport_t fixes.
	- typedefs in src/include/types.h now based on <sys/bitypes.h>
	- more opcodes 0F fixes in src/emu-i386/cpu.c.
	- cleaned a lot of print format errors. (%lx versus %x)
	From Hans
	- fixed '<>|' keyboard bug. It turned out MSDOS-6.2 was destroying
	  the CARRY in its INT15 AH=4F hook. The fix was not to rely on
	  CARRY=1 when called (forcing it to 1) in src/base/async/int.c
	- removed confusion '0.49' out of src/tools/peripher/hdinfo.c
97/10/11 ver. 0.67.13 released
	From Eric
	- some keyboard fixes to solve problems with the sticky shifts.
	- corrected some funny typo's ;-)
97/10/10 ver. 0.67.12.2 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- enabled 'new' port code, moved new code (from portss.c) to
	  n_ports.c  and integrated code that ist used by the old code
	  into ports.c. portss.c is no longer used.
	  The new code can be enabled via ./configure (--enable-new-port).
	- Now ioport_t (from types.h) is used all over the code.
	  However, for compatibility changed to unsigned int.
	- PCI code is now fully enabled.
	From Hans
	- DANG/README update/recompile
97/10/10 ver. 0.67.12.1 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- fixes to CDrom driver (undocumented bit 10 in CD status)
	  look at the comments in src/dosext/drivers/cdrom.c.
	- new config variable 'cdrom' added for more than 1 CDrom
	From Hans
	- (instead of Alberto;-) did update the README/config
	  to reflect the above config variable 'cdrom'.
97/09/26 ver. 0.67.12 released
	From Eric
	- new speaker code. Changes against old code:
	  Xsupport, variable sound duration (limited to 990ms),
	  turn-off on leavedos.
	From Hans
	- DANG update/recompile
97/09/23 ver. 0.67.11.2 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto,
	- final fixes for CPU detection, SMP now switches off RDTSC timing.
	- final AC-flags fixes (make the FoxPro fix obsolete)
	From Hans
	- disabled FoxPro fix from 0.67.11.1.
	- cleared up usage() in config.c.
	- max cardtype now in src/include/video.h (MAX_CARDTYPE),
	  so no need to take care of the constant in config.c ;-)
	- DANG recompile
97/09/21 ver. 0.67.11.1 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- fix (workaround) for FoxPro
	  clearing AC flag in dpmi.c (when trapno = 17)
	From Hans
	- 'cleaned' misleading usage of config.cpu_type and config.realcpu
	  cpu_type is what we show to DOS, realcpu is the CPU dosemu works on
	  Hence -3..-6 do _not_ change realcpu and can't be used to disable
	  the pentium timer. For this config.rdtsc should be used.
	- updated src/doc/README/config to reflect the latest changes.
97/09/20 ver. 0.67.11 released
	From Michael Karcher
	- fixed bug in src/dosext/misc/xms.c allocating unlimited memory.
	From Reinhard Karcher
	- fixed bug in n_serv_xlat.c concerning numerical ASCII input
	  over ALT-keypad. A variable sometimes wasn't initialized.
	From Eric
	- fixed possibe make recursion in Makefile.main, which happens
	  to occure with some newer make versions. (looks like the order
	  of making differs between versions).
	From Hans
	- made Eric happy ;-)  'cd src; make' now works again as expected.
	- temporary disabled Alberto's (0.67.10.3) pentium timer until he/we
	  find the bug which breaks FoxPro (when it uses XMS/EMS memory,
	  which it does by default) :-(
	  To re-enable it uncomment TEMP_DISABLED in the top Makefile.
	- Updated DANG_CONF such that it now collects all files, which
	  contain usefull DANG/SIDOC statements. Look at doc/DANG.txt ;-)
97/09/19 ver. 0.67.10.3 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	  final (except for bug fixing) part of timer patches:
	- revision of some comments
	- speed detection and override: new param config.realcpu taken out of
	  /proc/cpuinfo, -3, -4 e.t.c. can only downgrade this value.
	- CPU speed rounding to multiples of 30 and 33.3 in the range 60 to
	  300MHz (is it enough? maybe 500...)
	- replaced all gettimeofdays in timers.c and pic.c with the new
	  interface. Some needed gettimeofdays() are left though.
	- Deleted CLOCK_TICK_RATE because it were same value as PIT_TICK_RATE.
	- new code in cpu.c to reasonably emulate 'MOV to/from CRx' (0f xx xx)
	  The previous code (do_vm86.c, msdos.h) was incomplete.
	- using call to int0x06 instead of 'leavedos' in sigsegv.c making
	  happy CPU detection programs.
97/09/16 ver. 0.67.10.2 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	  first part of timer patches:
	- the timer driver itself and the new cpu/speed configuration:
	  emu-i386/cputime.c, include/timers.h, base/init/config.c etc.
	- replacement of the delay loops with the new interface:
	  keyboard, serial, sound (all the loops using RELATIVE timing).
	- documentation (refers to the final timer package)
	- timers and PIC have NOT been changed, they still use gettimeofday.
	  If this patch doesn't break anything, the round uses the real stuff.
97/09/16 ver. 0.67.10.1 unofficial pre-release
	From Uwe
	- fixing ./configure VERSION problem with textutils < 1.19
	- 'nicer' warning in Top-Makefile ;-)
	From Eric, Larry, Alberto  (all agree with this ;-)
	- disable 'could be dangerous' run_irqs() in base/dev/misc/timers.c
	From Alberto
	- Makefile.main: 'base/' missing before a 'data.o
	- speed up compilation of debugger/dis8086.c by uninlining a function
	- fix internaldriver for MouseSystems mouse.
	- parser.y: if user says '/dev/mouse', trust him and set the mouse flag
	- added pci driver, keyword PCI in /etc/dosemu.conf
	- changes to  32-bit port access.
	- Matrox driver updates
	- WDvga(Paradise) support
	- updates to vc.c for Matrox and WDvga
97/09/12 ver. 0.67.10 released
	From ramon@juguete.quim.ucm.es
	- gnats report misc/58, fixing:
	  'Dosemu cannot boot DOS from a partition at an origin > 2Gb'
	From David Bourgin <dbourgin@wsc.com>
	- changes to ./setup-hdimage:
	  - Use /sbin/fdisk, when /sbin not in the path.
	  - Offer non-bootable partitions too.
	  - Move -C option of mdexe to the end of the command to avoid
	    a shell misunderstanding.
	From Hans
	- get rid of some '#ifdef __linux__' concerning 'loff_t' in disk.*
	- small fix for DANG_c.pl not having the right version after the
	  configure changes.
97/09/09 ver. 0.67.9.1 unofficial pre-release
	From Hans
	- reworked the ./configure and Makefiles such that now there are
	  no Makefile*.in anymore except Makefile.conf.in, which gets
	  substituted by ./configure and holds all needed configuration
	  variables for the Makefiles. Makefile.conf gets included only in
	  the top Makefile and exports all variables to the slave-Makefiles.
	    - a simple 'make' runs ./default-configure if needed.
	      ( the user can't forget to run ./configure )
	    - no path substitution any more in the Makefiles, hence you
	      now can rename the directory (or copy it) and 'make'
	      can run.
	    - The version has been moved into the file VERSION, which
	      is parsed by ./configure and the top-Makefile, hence I need
	      only to change this one file ... and ./configure* is untouched.
	    - Some not used checks in ./configure have been disabled,
	      hence ./configure runs faster.
97/07/25 ver. 0.67.9 released
	From Alistair
	- fixed Makefile.main not to compile threads when not configured.
	- tests for the presence of 'libgus' in ./configure (SBEMU on).
	  If it's found then 'midid' will be compiled with that support,
	  otherwise it doesn't.
	- update to sound docs.
	From Hans
	- full docs recompile (DANG also)
	- mtools version check in setup-hdimage
	- some minor changes to mkbindist
	- introduced compiletime-settings.stable for making stable releases
	  out of 0.67 for 'joe user'. (0.66 is freezed now)
97/07/25 ver. 0.67.8.2 unofficial pre-release
	From Michael Karcher & Alistair
	- second round sound&dma patches
	  SB:
	    reworked asynchronous handler ('run_sb')
	    added 'run_sb' into DPMI loop
	    added support for MIDI & 16-bit IRQs
	    added missing function _call_ to sb_mixer_data_read
	    added extra SB16 Mixer commands
	    added SB16 DAC & ADC (stub)
	    added driver call 'play_buffer' [linux]
	    updated 'write_silence' to use 'play_buffer'
	    updated 0x1C DSP handling (for broken software)
	    added 'sb_set_rate' (some lengths are HI/LO, others LO/HI)
	    added automatic downgrade to SB-PRO
	  DMA:
	    fixed FF clear (now does!)
	    fixed Hi/Lo Byte swap (result of previous FF bug)
	    uses '|' instead of '+' where possible (quicker ?)
	    added 'dma_transfer_size' to alter handler's blocksize
	    added underflow checking to transfers
97/07/24 ver. 0.67.8.1 unofficial pre-release
	From Alistair
	- first round sound&dma&timer patches
	From Jan van.de.Werken <WERKEN@greefa.nl>
	- little bug fix for fossil.c
	From Alberto
	- small fix for n_X.c to compile without mitshm.
	From Hans
	- fixed the 'Linux-4.0.0' bug in lt-threads ;-)
	- corrected src/doc/README/batch, chapter 13 of README.txt was
	  garbage.
	- made config.X_mitshm = 0 default again. When Steffen fixed
	  the problems with X-color allocation, we'll re-change it.
97/07/19 ver. 0.67.8 released
	From Hans
	- lot of work on DANG (hey Alistair, hope you don't mind)
	 - made the keywords also accept 'SIDOC' instead of 'DANG, because
	   else I would have to maintain two versions of the threads
	   package (which I mainly use at office). Yeah, using the DANG
	   compiler now for my work at office ;-)
	 - Added some new features to DANG (have a look at chapter 12 and
	   13 of DANG.txt)
	 - edited _all_ DANG_*_MODULE entries such that now the contents
	   _really_ will appear in the 'Infomation' sections of DANG.txt.
	   (before all those valuable comments were ignored :-()
	- new threads version: 0.4
97/07/18 ver. 0.67.7.1 unofficial pre-release
	From Steffen
	- new (nearly) full implementation of vesa-2.0
	  - real true color support for DOS-applications (note: not to confuse
	    with emulation of 8bpp on a truecolor X-server)
	  - LFB support.
	    implemented special DPMI 0x0800 function (map physical)
	    to fake our virtual LFB.
	    (this need more work, too dangerous, --Hans)
	  - new dosemu.conf option for X {}:
	    lfb on/off, pm_interface on/off, defining new VESA modes.
	    look at doc/README.txt chapter 2.2.8.
	  - made 'X {mitshm}' default on, but can be switched off via
	    'X {mitshm off}'.
	  - gammcorrection now uses _only_ integer, no FPU usage any more.
	  - integrated old vgaemu_inside.h and vesa.h into vgaemu.h
	- fixed a bug in arch/linux/async/signal.c, wrong activation
	  of resize in text mode.
	- updated README/X.sgml and README/config to reflect all recent
	  X changes.
	From Hans
	- fixed Makefiles for odd behave on as86 generated objects:
	  bios.s, vesabios.o (tmp files dependencies went berserk)
	- fixed README/Makefile so sgml2tex won't screw up your screen;-)
	- changed docs to reflect the fact, that we now need libc-5.4.7
	  at minimum (due to mremap)
97/07/05 ver. 0.67.7 released
	From Alberto
	- fix for n_serv_xlat.c, grey +/- on num keypad.
	- fix for mhpdbgc.c, adjust segment limit value following the
	  granularity when disassembling.
	From Marty
	- some fixes to ./configure so it doesn't generate '-I' and
	  and barf the compiles.
	From Hans
	- kludge in src/dosext/misc/emm.c to work around kernel bug
	  (/proc/self/mem mapping again)
97/07/03 ver. 0.67.6.1 unofficial pre-release
	From Alistair
	- big docs rebuild. Nearly all README.s are now 'sgml' and the
	  source is in ./src/dos/README. In the ./doc directory there
	  these appear (compiled) as README.txt and README-tech.txt.
	From Hans
	- udapted the remaining docs, Makfiles and ./configure
	  to reflecting Alistairs changes.
97/06/29 ver. 0.67.6 released
	From Hans
	- fixes to EMM code (these bugs were long time in :-( )
	  The bug was introduced as HJ Lu recommended to use valloc() instead
	  of malloc() because of the page alignment of the malloc request.
	  So far so good, but we forgot that we do a realloc() and even
	  a free() on these allocations, ... and this _not_ complient with
	  the GNU specs of valloc(). In the old libc though it nevertheless
	  seemed to work, but not together with newer libc: The 0.66.6
	  binary distribution _is_ compiled against libc-5.4.23 and with
	  this the old EMM-test program that I once got from Jim is
	  crashing.
          In addition I also saw, that we did no proper handling for cases
	  when the new size for realloc() was ZERO. The realloc() returned
	  pointer isn't pagealigned (I even guess that realloc() should
	  not given a new zero size).
	  As a fix we now are using mmapp() (/dev/null) and mremap() also
	  for EMM. Though I could not test it under all conditions it
	  atleast fixed the bug for me. ... and it should be faster anyway.
97/06/28 ver. 0.67.5.1 unofficial pre-release
	From Michael an Reinhard Karcher <kar@dpk.berlin.fido.de>
	- fix for extended key-code (E0) in new and old kbd code.
	- fix for mfs.c: a DOS app that wants to read a newly created file
	  without reopen failed. Fix was to set the openflags in the SFT
	  to read/write instead of writeonly. ( same open mode mode as for
	  the linux file).
	From Alberto
	- fixed typo in bios.S (wrong SIM_INT(15) instead of SIM_INT(0x15))
	From Hans
	- some fixes to lt-threads
	  - kernel version dependent include of <linux/sched.h>
	  - fixed misaligned force_stack_expand, when using -malign-double
	    ( ... guess who jumped into this trap and found out what was
	    wrong?  Alberto! ;-)
	  - changed SIG_ACQUIRE to SIGUSR2 (src/include/emu.h) because
	    the SIGUSR1 collides with SIG_SUSPEND_WAKEUP in lt-threads.
	- made new kbd the default again (in-out-in ... what comes next?;-)
	- in src/dosext/dpmi/memory.c DPMIrealloc() use mremap() instead of
	  mmap()/memmove()/munmap(). Should be faster.
97/06/21 ver. 0.67.5 released
	From Hans
	- introducing threading into DOSEMU using Linux-clone :-)
	  Currently its only used for fixing the floppy ioctl that
	  will return with -EINTR (we normally switch off SIGALRM).
	  The main reason I put that stuff in is to show the team _how_ it
	  can be used within dosemu. So, Alistair its your turn now to
	  make the DMA stuff using it. And Steffen also may look how
	  we can make the X-update a thread. And of course Alberto now
	  has a base for his new PIC stuff.
	  Conclusion: Currently it should be considered as an example and
	  if we later come to the decision, thats not enhancing DOSEMU
	  enough, we may back out it.
	  BTW: its only activated by --enable-threads.
	- Made the old kbd again the default, because it breaks some of
	  the older DOS apps (extended code E0 again, forgot that we didn't
	  fix that yet, will come next).
97/06/19 ver. 0.67.4.3 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- Support for Matrox-Millenium ( video { ... chipset matrox } )
	From Hans
	- setting new kbd to default for default-configure
97/06/19 ver. 0.67.4.2 unofficial pre-release
	From Steffen
	- new X-update code
	- gamma correction ( X {gamma 100 } )
	- virtual memsize for vgaemu configurable ( X {vgaemu_memsize 1024} )
	- updating DANG for X and vgaemu
	From (multiple sources on linux-msdos ;-)
	- fix typo in src/include/linux/vm86.h (missing #endif)
97/06/15 ver. 0.67.4.1 unofficial pre-release
	From Steffen
	- fix for mitshm autodetect (src/env/video/X.c, .../n_X.c)
	From Michael Guennewig  <guenne00@marvin.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>
	- fixing invalid disk-geometry-information for drives tracks > 256
	- fixing invalid hdimage's for images with more than 65535 sectors or
	  (>=32MB) in mkfatimage16.c
	From Michael Harnois <mharnois@sbt.net>
	- some more work to make DOSEMU compile under glibc
	From Eric
	- fix for the (infamous) have-to-type-ESC-twice bug in the new kbd,
	  as it turned out, we forgot switch stdin into O_NONBLOCK mode.
	  (many kudos to Eric;-)
	From Hans
	- make target 'bindist', so I'll never forget the right params for
	  mkbindist (especially /usr/doc/dosemu ;-)
	- further enhancements to mkfatimage16.c (in addition to Michael's)
	  It turned out, that the hdimage was too inflexible for bigger
	  sizes and made a lot of trouble.
	  - new option -k: give size of hdimage in Kbytes. This adapts
	    the geometrie automatically to what is needed for the size.
	    ( heads, sectors_per_track are adjusted )
	  - new option -f: give the filename of the hdimage instead of
	    writing all to stdout.
	  - new option -p: when option -f also is given, pad the hdimage
	    with zero up to the exact filesize. This is required for
	    mtools-3.6 and when mounting the hdimage via /dev/lo.
	    The actual disk usage will be lower, because padding is realized
	    by makeing a big hole at the end.
	  - updated the man page
	- fix for IPX (gnats bug report files/46 from kees@schoen.nl)
	  setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, IPX_TYPE, ...) wrongly using
          SOL_SOCKET instead of SOL_IPX in src/dosext/net/net/ipx.c
	- fixed mkdexe so it can cope with DOSAPP not beeing an absolute path
	- fixed INT15-AH=4F not spawning a hooked TSR (src/base/bios/bios.S,
	  src/include/macros86.h), and backing out the incomplete fix of 0.67.4.
97/05/31 ver. 0.67.4 released
	From Alberto
	- disable ctrl-alt-del. (as its broken, better disable it)
	- deleted (unused) dos_ctrlc()
	From Ulrich Weigand <uweigand@easynet.de>
	- Several bugfixes to new keyboard code
	  - Raw client: ALT+Letter - Translation on non-US keyboards
	  - X client: didn't set AltGr flag in BIOS shiftstate (non-US)
	  - All clients: cursor block keys should yield ascii code 0xE0
	  - Hooking INT 15 AH=4F did not work
97/05/31 ver. 0.67.3.4 unofficial pre-release
				( taking over stuff from final 0.66.5 )
	From Hans
	- untill we can detect the availability of static libs, we
	  re-disable static linkage. ('linkstatic off')
	From Michael an Reinhard Karcher <kar@dpk.berlin.fido.de>
	- fix for wrongly placed leave_priv_setting() in ipxglt.c
	From Christian Kumpf <kumpf@igd.fhg.de>
	- fixed bug in dexe/mkdexe not proper handling option -d
	From Hans
	- changed mkdexe to accept *.tgz
	- LDFLAGS now '-Wl,-warn-common' to see were we have name clashes
	- repaired the linker warnings resulting from -warn-common by
	  - properly useing EXTERN in vga.h, serial.h
	  - removed multiple definitions of 'serial_t com[MAX_SER];'
	  - removed overriding 'struct debug_flags d' definition in config.c
	- fixed IPX not closing sockets on leavedos()
	  ( gnats report misc/39 from Kees <kees@schoen.nl> )
	- adapted /proc/meminfo (dpmi/meminfo.c) scanning to Linux-2.1.41
97/05/24 ver. 0.67.3.3 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- timers.c: reorganized pit_latch
	  - simplified access to pit[latch] with a pointer
	  - changed mode test from a switch{} to an if..else
	  - merged code for modes 2 and 3
	  - implemented output pin (status bit 7). A request for status
	    calls pit_latch with mode flag 0x40; the output pin status is
	    recalculated and the mode flag changed to 0x80. The following
	    read will get the complete status byte, then the mode flag will
	    be reset from inside pit_inp.
	  - this patch also corrects a bug, ndiags now runs fine.
	From Hans
	- made 'linkstatic' and 'tmonoton' default
	  (static binaries have better performance and less timer problems)
97/05/23 ver. 0.67.3.2 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- timers.c, pit.c: use NEVER instead of -1 in monoton timing
	- timers.c: removed duplicate calc of 'ticks'
	- timers.c (pit_inp): avoid changing read_state for the special latch
	  status command; otherwise next read will get MSB instead of LSB.
	- cdrom.c: avoid binary sector dumps into log file, use ASCII
	  reworked debug messages a bit
	- patch to serial code to activate transmit FIFO
	From Hans
	- fixed bug in src/dosext/drivers/cdrom.c (ebx twice set),
	  that Alberto pointed out (aaah, these eagle eyes ;-)
97/05/23 ver. 0.67.3.1 unofficial pre-release
	From Gloriano Frisoni <gfrisoni@hi-net.it>
	- patch to make winsocket stuff work under win31
	  Using trumpet winsock, netscape, eudora, mirc, free agent e.t.c
	  now run under dosemu. For more read doc/README.Winnet
97/05/19 ver. 0.67.3 released
	From Alberto
	- some more comments on DIRECT_DPMI_CONTEXT_SWITCH
	- removed bogus RCS printout in src/dosext/misc/xms.c
	- some remaining fixes on USE_INT_QUEUE
	- some fixes in DPMI
	  - low 12 bits in limit > 1M was not checked
	  - forgotten 'volatile' in do_LAR
	  - logging of ingnored 0x0506-0x0508,0x0700,0x0702,0x0703
	    DPMI-functions
	  - asm code for copy_context under DIRECT_DPMI_CONTEXT_SWITCH
	  - DPMI page fault should do leavedos()
	  - dead loop detection for 'cli' in dpmi_fault()
	From Steffen
	- (some) fix to cut&paste in src/env/video/n_X.c
	From Eric
	- src/base/keyboard/n_keyb_X.c:   Added some missing key
	  definitions. Needed to get the keypad keys working in X when
	  numlock is off.
97/05/19 ver. 0.67.2.1 unofficial pre-release
				( taking over stuff from pre-0.66.5 )
	From Alberto
	- fixed bug for DIRECT_DPMI_CONTEXT_SWITCH, copy_context was
	  forgotten at some places. (src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c)
	From Ingo Brueckl <ib@wupperonline.de>
	- bugfix for 'make install' not installing man/*dos*.1
	From Michael an Reinhard Karcher <kar@dpk.berlin.fido.de>
	- fixed bug for DPMI src/base/async/int.c, INT2f AX=1686 not
	  correctly reporting CPU status.
	From Hans
	- fixes and enhancement for bootable hdimage generation
	  - dexe/extract-dos can detect DOS types.
	  - setup-hdimage makes use of DOS type detection. The following
	    DOSes now can be made bootable for DOSEMU via setup-hdimage:
		PCDOS, NWDOS, MSDOS, WIN95, FreeDos
	  - fixed extract-dos to take windows/command.com when WIN95
	  - new option for mkdexe: '-C comcom', here you can define
	    an other command.com (e.g.4dos).
	  - introduced 'write permissions' in DEXE files so that the
	    DOS-app can (isolated) write to files within the DEXE,
	    even if the file permissions don't allow that. This is
	    a workaround for a general problem with DEXEs, look at
	    ./doc/README.dexe for more details.
	    For this, dexeconfig has a new option -p {w|W}
	- new config option for DEXE: xdosonly. When set it terminates
	  dosemu, when no X available, else it forces xdos.
	- bug fix for 'forcexdos'
	- force a BootC unconditionally for DEXE
	- increased number of allowed disks to 16 (there was report of
	  a user who had 11 disks ;-)
	- fixed a bug in the 'class' stuff (could not access within scope
	  of /etc/dosemu.conf)
	- fixed parser not aborting, when parserror in -I or DEXE.
	- added (implicit) setting of configuration variable h_<ownhost>
	  This can be checked in /etc/dosemu.conf to restrict access for
	  given diskless machines, that mount a dosemu containing FS.
	- added two new dosemu.conf statements:
	  - abort <message>   which prints message to stderr and leaves dos.
	  - warn  <message>   which just prints a message into the logfiles
			      using c_printf.
	- added the tiny 'ezedit' editor to src/commands/precompiled
	- Updating the docs _a lot_ ;-)
	  - added doc/README.lredir
	  - added man/mkfatimage16
	  - reworked Quickstart to reflect setup-hdimage, moved description
	    of the old method to doc/README.oldboot
	  - removed etc/BOGUS-Notes (was quite bogus;-)
	  - added a src/tools/QuickStart.bindist, which will be used for
	    making the binary distribution (see below)
	  - e.t.c
	- reworked ./etc/config.dist again and added a bit more comments ;-)
	  - we now have the following examples:
		./etc/config.dist
		./etc/dosemu.users.easy
		./etc/dosemu.users.secure
	  - config.dist is generic, i.e. it checks for config variables
	    set in dosemu.user such as
		guest
		secure
		vbootfloppy
	- fixed a bug (report: Hans-Joachim Baader <hans@grumbeer.inka.de>)
	  in src/base/init/parser.y, parsing dosemu.users crashed on empty
	  lines.
	- Finally assembled a binary distribution. Put all stuff needed for
	  that in to src/tools. In principal you just have to execute
	     ./src/tools/mkbindist -m -s -d usr/doc
	  and after this will have a complete tree in /tmp/dosemu-<version>
	  that only needs to be tar'ed.
	- changed Makefile.main.in such that you now can specify a directory
	  into which the installation will be done (needed that for
	  mkbindist). Example: 'make "INSTROOT=/tmp/dosemu-bin" install'
	- changed default-configure so that it accepts further ./configure
	  options such as './default-configure --host=i386-unknown-linux'
97/05/10 ver. 0.67.2 released
	From Eric
	- Fixed a bug where shift number pad key only worked if _both_ left
	  and right shifts were pressed (src/base/keyboard/n_serv_xlat.c)
97/05/10 ver. 0.67.1.3 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- isolate and undefine unused code: hlt and int_queue
	- missing flush_log() in src/emu.c
97/05/05 ver. 0.67.1.2 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- fix for inconsistent (EMU_)MAX_IO_DEVICES
	- Microsoft mouse protocol fixes. It was erroneously merged with
	  the MouseMan 3-4 byte variable length protocol, while Microsoft
	  has a 3-byte fixed protocol (A.Rubini confirmed).
	- some comments & small fixes (continued)
97/05/05 ver. 0.67.1.1 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- fixes for typos
	- some comments added
	- cleaned extra dependencies in makefile, removed pic include dir
	- very small bug fixes:
	  - exception 16 feed to IRQ13, src/arch/linux/async/sigsegv.c
	  - usleep for hogthreshold changed to INT28_IDLE_USECS
	  - added INT10 AH=CC (for NC 5.0) in src/base/bios/int10.c
	-From Eric
	  fixed trashing AL in src/base/bios/bios.S (INT09_dummy_start)
97/05/03 ver. 0.67.1 released
	From Steffen
	- cool new X-stuff:
	  - X mode support (doom now displays right)
	  - first simple 4plane mode (very slow)
	  - 24/32 bpp possible
	  - linear/bilinear interpolation for bpp >15
	  - resizing of graphics windows now possible
	  - DAC-updates also in textmode possible
	  - a lot of new config options (see ./doc/README.config)
	From Hans
	- made the new X-code a configure option (--enable-new-X),
	  because Steffen apparently optimized it for 'games' ;-)
	  (which indeed run faster), but the new stuff (atleast for win31)
	  has performance problems with 'normal' graphics applications.
	  ... still searching what's causing this trouble :-(
	- some small fixes and 'compatibility adjusts' to Steffens patch ;-)
	  (the new X-code should now work atleast as stable as the old one)
	- INT10 now handles AX=1015 and AX=1017 (these missing ones broke
	  Steffens new DAC-update in X-textmode)
97/05/03 ver. 0.67.0.3 unofficial pre-release
	From Doug Dougherty, Chicago, IL
	- cmdline DOS tool to feed in info from the commandline
	  into the DOS-environement.
	  (see src/command/README)
	From Eric
	- Enabled the speaker/timer code of the NEW_KBD_CODE in
	  src/emu-i386/ports.c (inb) (outb)
	- Unconditionally remove the original copy of dos before relinking.
	  in src/arch/linux/Makefile.main.in (dossubdirs)
	From Hans ( ... and some ideas from Alistair ;-)
	- new cool configuration stuff. Dosemu.conf can now parse
	  conditionally and include files.
	- In dosemu.users variables can be set, which you later can test in
	  dosemu.conf. For more see ./doc/README.config.
	- can define a variable also on the commandline (option -u). You
	  then may check it in dosemu.conf and behave differently.
	- removed all comments in etc/config.dist and moved the information
	  into ./doc/README.config.
97/05/02 ver. 0.67.0.2 unofficial pre-release
	From Alistair
	- fixes and enhancements to gnats/send-pr
	From Bart
	- fix for a multicasting bug in dosnet.c
	- warning in libpacket.c.multi, when insufficient privilege
	From Karl Kiniger <ki@boss.kretz.co.at>
	- some more enter_priv* brackets within src/dosext/net/net/ipx.c
	  and src/dosext/net/net/ipxglt.c
	From Uwe
	- some 'secure on' warning, and a errorcode return fix (DPMI)
	- (needed tools for developing win31 mouse.drv) some doshelper changes:
	  - overall symbolic names now
	  - new DOS_HELPER_DOSEMU_CHECK checks wether running under X
	  - new DOS_HELPER_PRINT_STRING lets DOSapp print a string into
	    our logfile.
	From Hans
	- first round to make a binary distribution (static).
	  A complete tree gets generated via ./src/tools/mkbindist.
	  We choose statically linked binaries, because of the many
	  different libc versions floating around. Not all of them are
	  down/upward compatible and some even aren't useable for dosemu.
	  ( ... and surpise, the static binary runs a bit faster )
	- new ./configure option: --enable-linkstatic
97/04/30 ver. 0.67.0.1 unofficial pre-release
	From Hans
	- further enhancements to DEXE stuff
	  - hdimages containing DEXE get a magic "\x0eDEXE"
	  - configuration is now (hidden from file access) put into
	    cylinder 0 (behind the MBR)
	  - dosemu now handles DEXE loading itself ( option -L)
	    a 'dosexec' sym-linked dos sets -L option (like xdos does -X)
	  - a DEXEs hdimage is always drive C, if not explicitle allowed
	    via 'dexe { allowdisk }', no other disk will be available
	    even if defined in /etc/dosemu.conf
	  - Option -F is forbidden for DEXE, so the security settings
	    in /etc/dosemu.conf can't be disabled.
	  - 'secure on' can be forced in /etc/dosemu.conf for DEXE,
	    even if 'off' otherwise.
	  - 'dexe { forcexdos }' forces xdos, when DEXE is run on X.
	    This can be included in DEXE-configurations, when the
	    application requires graphics and would bomb on Slang otherwise.
	  - New tool: src/tools/periph/dexeconfig, which inserts/extracts
	    the configuration file from a DEXE
	  - updated dexe/mkdexe to reflect the changes
97/04/20 ver. 0.67.0 released
	From Hans
	- Opening the new development phase
	- no further changes except the version number increase
97/04/20 ver. 0.66.3 released
	From Hans
	- new hdimage generation stuff, need mtools-3.6:
	  ./setup-hdimage makes a bootable hdimage from the DOS the user
		has already installed under native DOS
		I tried this with the following OSes:
		FreeDos, MSDOS-6.2, WINDOWS'95.
		Other DOSes should also work, when the names of the
		system files are given on prompt.
		(Next step will be to automatically transform the
		 config.sys and autoexec.bat ;-)
	  ./dexe/mkdexe generates a direct executable DOS-app (hdimage
		containing just one app). The extension is *.dexe
	  ./dexe/dosexec executes a *.dexe
	  ./dexe/do_mtools symplifies the access to a hdimage
	  ./dexe/extract-dos takes the bootsector and the system files
		out of a dos partition or a hdimage
	  All this stuff is described in ./doc/README.dexe and the
	  Quickstart.
97/04/17 ver. 0.66.2.2 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- fix for INT8 rescheduled to fast in DPMI
	From Hans
	- new dosdebug commands: 'log' and 'dump'
	  With 'log' you can change/display the debug-logging flags such as
	  'log +M-k' on the fly within dosdebug.
	  With 'dump' you may write any piece of allowed dosemu mem to
	  a file, such as 'dump cs:100 1234 /dosc/xxx.com'
	  (wishes from Grant R. Guenther, the great parallel ZIP hacker ;-)
97/04/16 ver. 0.66.2.1 unofficial pre-release
	From Hans
	- 'keystroke' feature now also available for new-kbd
	From Alberto
	- fix for src/base/misc/priv.c (forgotten return)
97/04/12 ver. 0.66.2 released
	From Alberto
	- minimal patch needed to fix the mode-0 timer bug for
	  MONOTON_MICRO_TIMING
	From Hans
	- added direct bootable 'tiny' FreeDos etc/hdimage.test.
	  This can be started via ./first-test. For more have a look
	  at ./Quickstart and ./contrib/dosC/readme.dosemu.
	- Added option -b to src/tools/periph/mkfatimage16.c in order
	  to allow inserting the FreeDos bootsector.
	- fixed a remaining security hole:
	  'secure' was off by default and when a user uses -F it
	  was left 'off' :-(
	- udapted docs.
97/04/09 ver. 0.66.1.5 unofficial pre-release
	From Hans
	- added 'keystroke' feature, you may now feed DOSEMU with key
	  strokes, that are automagically typed in as if from the keyboard.
            dos -D-a -I 'keystroke "\F8;\p200;6"
          Will press F8, then wait 2 seconds, then type 6.
	  For more details see etc/config.dist and doc//README.batch
	From Marty
	- use gawk instead of awk in setup stuff, else 'next' isn't supported.
	  ( gnats report misc/13 )
97/04/04 ver. 0.66.1.4 unofficial pre-release
	From Hans
	- complete rework of the privs stuff, now we _really_ can
	  run as user, and this is now the default!
	  (note: run as user means that dosemu mostly has user privs)
	  For more details see ./doc/README.runasuser and
	  src/base/misc/README.privs
	- updated the docs concernig 'run as user' and new privs stuff
	- Fixed some warnings in lexer.l and parser.y
97/04/04 ver. 0.66.1.3 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- (hopefully) final fix for >2G over mfs.
	From Marty
	- search for slang.h in /usr/local/include
	From Hans
	- fixed gnats report memory/10
	  (rep. by David E. Kingsley <camel@hysteria.crisis.net>)
	  set XMS_DRIVER_VERSION to 0x0301
97/04/04 ver. 0.66.1.2 unofficial pre-release
	From Uwe
	- cleaned up keyb_layout presetting in src/base/init/parser.y
	- defaulting to KEYB_US now, when under X and _no_ X_keycode
	From Marky (hi;-)
	- changed his non-working mail addresses
97/04/04 ver. 0.66.1.1 unofficial pre-release
        From Hans
	- added a DOSEMU-special MBR to hdimage.
	  This is the world premiere of MBR running in 32-bit protected mode;-)
	  ( no need to use 'fdisk /MBR' any more )
97/03/28 ver. 0.66.1 released
	From Hans
	- added a new commandline option: -I
	  Wow, is that powerfull!! ;-) It makes a lot of people happy
	  that complained about inflexible configuration (for a more
	  detailed description read man/dos.1). It makes the following
	  (and much more) possible:
		dos ... -I 'video { mda }'
		dos ... -I "`cat my_other_dosemu.conf`"
		dos ... -I "`my_special_config_script.sh`"
          hmm... waiting for people reporting it has security issues ;-)
          (but you before report them: -I runs under the same secure level
           as .dosrc)
	- fixed a security hole: user could disable 'secure on' :-(
	- updated the docs
	From Alistair
	- fixed gnats report misc/9 (rep. by mharris@blackwidow.saultc.on.ca)
	  (error while running setup-dosemu)
97/03/27 ver. 0.66.0.4 unofficial pre-release
	From Alistair
	- made sound a disable option in /etc/dosemu.conf ('sound_emu off')
	  (else it may clobber an IRQ, if configured but not used)
	From Philip.Blundell@pobox.com
	- some compile fixes for glibc
97/03/27 ver. 0.66.0.3 unofficial pre-release
	From Bart Hartgers <barth@stack.nl>
	- Made dosnet.c running under 2.0.x kernel (was broken)
	From Hans
	- again fixes to ./configure & slang.h :(
97/03/26 ver. 0.66.0.2 unofficial pre-release
	From Soos Peter <sp@osb.hu>
	- added support for hungarian keyboard
	From Hans
	- fixed gnats report misc/8 (rep. by Ambrose Li)
	  In configure, if 'no X' the XINCLUDES was preset with a comment
	  (what joker invented that?) such as "# no special path needed".
	  This made the following -I...slang.h invisible in INCDIR.
97/03/26 ver. 0.66.0.1 unofficial pre-release
	From Hans Zoebelein <zocki@goldfish.cube.net>
	- fix for error printout, when reading a write protected floppy.
	From Steffen
	- fix typo in priv_drop()
	From Andries.Brouwer@cwi.nl
	- fix for ./configure to detect slang.h correctly
	- making rm -f `find ...` not complaining, when nothing found
	- small 'warning avoid' in src/emu-i386/portss.c
	From Hans
	- fix for gnats report misc/4
	  When no XINCLUDES is set, it left a stale '-I'
	- fix wrong gcc check in ./configure (reported by Jeff Epler)
	  checking now for $GCC=yes
97/03/21 ver. 0.66.0 released
	From Hans
	- fix to ./configure, -without-x gots messed up in 0.65.99.23
	- Docs update

--------

97/03/20 ver. 0.65.99.26 unofficial pre-release
	From Alistair
	- DANG cleanup, added DANG-compiler
	- recompiled DANG.sgml --> DANG.txt (-- Hans)
97/03/20 ver. 0.65.99.25 unofficial pre-release
	From Alistair & Rutger
        - For 0.66 we have updated many areas and re-organised others to
	  make it easier to maintain.
          Many thanks to David Brauman <crisk@netvision.net.il> for finding so
          many bugs
	- new sound stuff. 'midid' reworked,
          goes into directory src/arch/linux/dosext/sound/midid
	  Compile it with 'make midid'
	- Added in support for the handler to reject the completion.
97/03/19 ver. 0.65.99.24 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- fix for 'partitions >500M' part 2 (wrong sector rounding)
	- Fixes and correcter calculations for config.freq, which can
	  be set in dosemu.conf to adjust what dosemu takes for a second.
	  (units in DOS timer clocks, 18 make one second). TIMER_DIVISOR
	  is the constant (6) to make one Unix-tick (at 100Hz) out of the
	  DOS-ticker.
97/03/17 ver. 0.65.99.23 unofficial pre-release
	From Hans
	- new targets in main Makfile: docs, docsinstall, docsclean
	From Pavel Kankovsky <kan@dcit.cz>
	- fixes for X-detection
	From Steffen (realized by Hans;)
	- emulate a down counting 'diskette motor timeout'
	  old games seem to rely on that.
	From Alberto:
	- small mouse fix (320x200)
	- discovered that int2f,ax=110c fails for partitions >500M, because
	  it can't set cluster size>8. Here is my fix, which should also avoid
	  overflows on >2G disks.
97/03/16 ver. 0.65.99.22 unofficial pre-release
	From Hans
	- docs move around:
	  all doc source go into src/doc/DANG, src/doc/HOWTO
          made Makfiles to generate 'nice' docs.
          You have to 'cd src/doc' then do 'make'
          To install the *.txt into ./doc type 'make install'
	NOTE: the patch to this release is a patch-*.tgz, what means,
              you have have to un-tar it into the ./dosmemu directory and then
              type 'sh tmp/do_patch'.
	      This will _first_ move the files, and then apply the patch.
97/03/15 ver. 0.65.99.21 unofficial pre-release
	From Uwe
	- take version date out of ./Changelog
	From Alberto
	- 'make pristine' removes 'gen.log'
	From Alstair and Rutger
	- new sound stuff
97/03/14 ver. 0.65.99.20 unofficial pre-release
	=== CLEANUP-Release ===
	From Hans
	- first round 'JES --> Hans' doc changes
	- new README.batch
	- preparation for 0.66 (version changes in docs)
	- check DPR a bit, but the rest is to Alistair ;-)
	- removed all RCS headers (not using any more)
	- well, and found that compiling without VM86PLUS was broken,
	  fixed it in parser.y
	From Alberto
	- lots of typos fixed (collected cleanups)
	- some more debug prints in pic.c
97/03/14 ver. 0.65.99.19 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- 1st arg of log_printf becomes 'int'
	- (some) fix for the inte6 problem (80x50)
	- missing HLT_OFF in DPMI 'free realmode call back address' (0x0304)
	- Without this CDs can't be changed:
	  force media_changed, when ejecting (src/dosext/drivers/cdrom.c),
	  _realy_ do CDROMRESET in cdrom_reset()
97/03/12 ver. 0.65.99.18 unofficial pre-release
	From Alistair
	- Further gnats enhancements
	From Hans
	- Because 'midi' always was created in the default directory (which
	  also is the name of the 'midi' executable ;-) ), I
	  renamed the 'midi' file to /var/run/dosemu-midi, removed the
          'create' on open and checked for 'is open' when writeing to it.
	  Updated README.sound accordingly.
	From Uwe
	- second try (;-) to make compiling on NFS mounted directory
          possible
97/03/11 ver. 0.65.99.17 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- deleted 'rm modules' in src/arch/linux/Makefile.main.in
	  (obsolete)
	- fixed 'regs' parsing in dosdebugger.
	- banner now prints correct time
	- fixed relocation of INT42 (must be a copy of INT10)
	- call setmode() of video driver only if pointer valid (int10.c)
	- disable -Y -Z, when X not configured.
	- some 'close mouse' fixes
	- temp fix to dpmi.c int31 just to avoid hard reboots
	- fix for auto-mitshm-disable stuff in X.c
	- corrected wrong (port,value) parameters in s3.c
	- do not debug while VC is not active (in src/env/video/vc.c)
	- removed some stale files
	- avoid pktdrvr.h to be multiple included
	From Hans
	- removed stale references to emusys.h
	- elaborated the description of the 'ttylocks {}' option in
	  etc/config.dist.
97/03/08 ver. 0.65.99.16 unofficial pre-release
	From Steffen
	- Added code to turn off MIT-SHM for network connections.
	From Uwe
	- small additional debug out for DPMI
97/03/07 ver. 0.65.99.15 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- cleanup for CFLAGS in configure(.in)
	- corrections in etc/config.dist
	- missing exception 16 handling in src/arch/linux/async/sigsegv.c
	- various fixes in src/base/async/int.c, temp fix for Ctrl-C bug
	  in Djgpp (int 23 revectored and caputered).
	- changed 0/1 to REVECT/NO_REVECT
	- cleanup of usage message in src/base/init/config.c
	  and fix wrong cardtype number
	- fixes to buffered debug out (log_printf).
	- mouse fix (serial/int14.c)
	- fixed 'hlt' optimization in run_dpmi()
	- cleaned up 'case 1..2:' to 'case 1: case 2:' in various places
	- in_dos_21 warnings fixed
	- some mfs fixes.
	From Thomas Winder <thomas.winder@sea.ericsson.se>
	- struct sigaction fixes for glibc-2 in src/arch/linux/async/signal.c
	From Hans
	- fix for default-configure
	- made 'irqpassing' a synonym for 'sillyint', because users
	  apparently get confused. Also adapted config.dist
97/03/07 ver. 0.65.99.14 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- Fix for the mouse garrot helper: using INT28_IDLE_USECS
	- fix for non compileing new kbd (unintentionally reverse patch
	  at state of 0.65.99.4 in conjunction with priv_* cleanup)
	- remove src/dosext/dpmi/kernel.diffs (obsolete)
	- remove src/Configure (broken, obsoleted by Alistairs stuff)
	- added rebuild script
	From Hans
	- added ./set-permissions, which sets all exec-bits for all scripts
	  (so when upgrading per patch, this scripts gets it right)
	- added ./default-configure, this script should be used instead
	  of ./configure, because it interpretes the compiletime-settings
	  which can be changed by Alistairs setup-dosemu stuff.
	- changed setup/compiletime_setup.sh so it uses ./default-configure
	  to interprete the various menu variables (have now only one place
          to take care of it;-)
97/03/07 ver. 0.65.99.13 unofficial pre-release
	From Alistair
	- fixes for setup & gnats
	  (Yeah, now it works fine; and Alistair has time for his sound ;-)
	From Hans
	- send-pr gets dosemu-version out of ./configure.in
	- stole lxdialog, named it 'demudialog' and adapted setup gnats
	  to use that. (normal dialog shows a strange handling, when used
	  for Alistairs stuff)
	  I hope Alistair will enhance 'demudialog' to fit our needs
	  again better ;-)
97/02/29 ver. 0.65.99.12 unofficial pre-release
	From Alistair
	- setup stuff from 0.65
	- gnats stuff from 0.65
	From Uwe
	- New dosemu-HOWTO.*, EMUfailure.txt
	  (deleted EMUsuccess.txt)
97/02/29 ver. 0.65.99.11 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- Fixes for 'unix.com'
	- little PIC fix: maybe it is better not to blindly decrement timer
	  values if they are set to NEVER.
97/02/28 ver. 0.65.99.10 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- Use a big buffer for debug messages, this doesn't slow down
	  dosemu, when debugging.
	From Hans
	- Made the above 'big buffer' an item in /etc/dosemu.conf:
          'logbufsize <SIZE>', default is _no_ buffering.
	- Fixed ./configure.in, so it now doesn't use -fomit-frame-pointer
	  when configured for debugging.
97/02/27 ver. 0.65.99.9 unofficial pre-release
	From Adrian Sun <asun@zoology.washington.edu>
	- Make dosemu compile under glibc 2.0.1
	- Small IPX bug fix: have the initfile.c functions return on a failed
	  open. Workaround for missing IPX_TYPE = 1 in glibc headers.
	- convert a missed SignalHander -> __sighandler_t
97/02/27 ver. 0.65.99.8 unofficial pre-release
	From Uwe:
	- base/misc/disks.c, include/disks.h, tools/periph/hdinfo.c
	  Use llseek on Linux to allow access on Files greater 2.1 GBytes
	- made 'make install' on NFS mounted FS possible
	  (compiling as user, installing as root)
97/02/27 ver. 0.65.99.7 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- Fix for debugger, recent 'nm' has 16 hexdigits for addesses
	From Hans
	- made the path of dosemu.map defineable in /etc/dosemu.conf:
	  'dosemumap <STRING>'
97/02/25 ver. 0.65.99.6 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto & Hans
	- workaround for bug in kernel vm86plus that Alberto found
          (fixing kernel patch did reach Linus already;-)
          We will remove the workaround when time goes by
	- added runtime kernel version check ( currently only used
	  by the above workaround)
97/02/23 ver. 0.65.99.5 unofficial pre-release
	From Alistair & Rutger
	- Updated SB DSP code and fixed some bugs in detection - Alistair
	- Re-hacked ports.c so the DMA code works again. GRRRRR - Alistair
	- Added first pass at MPU-401 code - Rutger
97/02/22 ver. 0.65.99.4 unofficial pre-release
	From Eric Biederman <ebiederm@cse.unl.edu>
	- priv_on/off/default cleanup
97/02/21 ver. 0.65.99.3 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- Support for CIRRUS chipsets (some code comon with S3: v_8514)
	From Hans
	- fixed typos (mine) for ATI: in Makefile.in and lexer.l
97/02/20 ver. 0.65.99.2 unofficial pre-release
	From Josef Pavlik <jetset@ibm.net>
	- Added ATI support (untested --Hans)
	  This patch is for VGA ATI Mach 64 (probably will work with Mach8
	  and Mach32 too).  Set "video { vga console graphics chipset ati }"
	  in dosemu.conf. Resolves problem with ioports >0x3ff and saves
	  registers which contains clock speed. Without this patch dosemu
	  changes clock speed of VGA.
97/02/20 ver. 0.65.99.1 unofficial pre-release
	From Alberto
	- Fix PIC bug (replacment for old ALBERTO_KLUDGE)
	From Hans
	- fixed a small typo (yes, it was mine),
	  ( did use close(f) instead of fclose(f) :((  )
97/02/17 ver. 0.65.99 unofficial pre-release,
			 first round targeting 0.66, 0.67
	From Hans
	- Collected the keyboard patches from 0.63.1.56 .. 0.63.1.98
	  ( from Rainer Zimmermann <zimmerm@mathematik.uni-marburg.de> )
	  and adapted them on top of 0.64.4.
	  Fixed some bugs (which very likely also bothered 0.65.0),
	  added the recent Slang and codetable changes, restored the
	  original filenames for the old files (patch now readable),
          and got it finaly working.
	  The old keyboard stuff remains active per default.
	  The new stuff (--enable-new-kbd) also runs fine (atleast on the 3
          machines I have tested), except that ESC on Slangkeyboard has
	  to be typed twiced (result of 'dead keys for accents' ?).

--------------

97/02/04 ver. 0.64.4 released
	From Hans
	- Adapted Steffen Winterfeld's (graphics) true color patch from
	  0.63.1.98 (not his newest from .65) to 0.64.x.
          The code now looks a bit kludgy, because it was written for .98,
          but works great. Scaling (x2) is set for 320x200, so you may miss
          the 'mini window' ;-) also win31 is happy.
	- Added optimized XModeRemap functions for 15/16 bit true color.
	- Upgraded to Slang0.99-38 and fix the odd situation when the
	  system supplied libslang was included, but the headerfiles were
	  taken from dosemu (showing the wrong slang version).
	  Now it uses _completely_ the dosemu or the system supplied files.
	  There is a new ./configure option to force use of the dosemu
	  supplied slanglib: --enable-force-slang
	  BTW: slang.h is now in src/include/slang/*
	- Removed and disabled use of a.out (deleted slang-a.out-lib)
	  for arch-linux.
	- fixed compile warning keyboard-client.c. and changed some
	  'error()' to 'v_printf()' in int10.c
	- made the 'unexpected CPU exception 0x06' error show the correct
	  registers.
	- Fixed the wrong prefix handling in dpmi.c (dpmi_fault),
	  Thanks to Alberto who pointed this out.
	- Added 'secure' option in /etc/dosemu.conf, which disables
          generation of 'whole userspace' descriptors. A DPMI client
          otherwise can modify (a suid root running) dosemu, such that it
          may execute arbitrary commands.
          This option also disables the use of the 'unix' and 'system'
          commands (dos-helper functions 0x50...0x53).
	From John Davis
	- Slang needs -lm with newer libc.
	- If the function and arrow key definitions are in the
	  terminfo library, it will use those
	- Lower the TIMEOUT value for the ESC character from 3/4
	  of a second to 1/4 of a seconds.
	From Andreas Arens <andras@cww.de>
	- New support for Avance Logic VGA cards, needs this in dosemu.conf:
	  video { vga  console  graphics  chipset avance }
	From Alberto
	- Patch for makeing debug print checks faster
	  (ifprintf -> log_printf)
	- Makefile.main patch to fix odds in newer binutils.
97/01/22 ver. 0.64.3.1 released
	From Hans (final fixes)
	- Removed rest of 'history' in include/vm86plus
	- reinstalled include/linux/vm86.h (to avoid compile errors
	  when using libc < 5.4.7)
	- corrected VM86P* typo
	- fixed wrong message on 'make install'
	- made Bernd's timer patch a configure option, because apparently
	  some games don't like it. (--enable-monoton-timing)
97/01/19 ver. 0.64.3 released
	From Hans
	- removed emumodule (don't need it any more;-)
	- cleaned up kernel dependencies
	- adapted ./configure and Makefiles
	- Made mouse functionable for win31-in-xdos (hiding X-cursor,
          calibrating win31 cursor)
	- little fix for xtermdos
	- Updated the docs
	From JES
	- basic mouse functionality for win31-in-xdos
	From Herbert Xu <herbert@greathan.apana.org.au>
	- additions to man/dos.1, man/xtermdos.1
96/12/30 ver. 0.64.2.2 released
	From Erik Mouw
	- sequencer emulator for VGAemu (compatible with Trident 8900)
	  This lets WIN31 run in xdos :-), ... but without mouse :-(
96/12/30 ver. 0.64.2.1 released
	From Hans
	- Finaly got expand-down-fake in DPMI work, so older DJGPP work again.
	  ( and maybe some games too )
	- Additional checks in ./configure for debian inconsistencies,
	  Forcing to ELF, if no GCC specs file available.
	- ... and this time did not forget to increase the version ;-)
	From Erik Mow
	- Additional checks in ./configure for bison installed
	From Grant R. Guenther <grant@knot.torque.net>
	( hey, Grant is the man who hacked the ZIP and other drives using
          dosemu, so he then could write the Linux drivers ;-)
	- "T" debug flag and LOG_IO macro
	From Bernd Paysan <paysan@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>
	- fixed the keycodes for AccelX
	- fix for micro timing problems, timer now strictly monotonous
	  ( Bernd's fix _really_ works great, Hans:-)
96/12/07 ver. 0.64.2 released
	From Hans:
	- vm86plus (2nd version) now is in the kernels >= 2.1.15
	  ( it took long, but we finaly succeeded, thanks Linus :-)
	- small adaptation and cleanup (docs, configure)
	- minor fixes for clean compile under various compile options
	- key-board fix for french keyboards (from Alain Knaff)
96/12/07 ver. 0.64.2-pre5 (privat release for JES only)
        From Hans:
	- vm86plus (emumodule), third round
	  ( Linus requested to put our stuff into a separate syscall )
	  kernel patches now for 2.0.27, 2.1.14
	- small fix for -F bug.
	- DPMI: tried to work around illegitime expand-down segments
96/11/15 ver. 0.64.1
        From Hans:
        - vm86plus (emumodule), second round
          kernel patches 2.0.25, 2.1.8 (fits also in 2.1.10)
	  see doc/README.kernel
        - REQUIRES_EMUMODULE has become REQUIRES_VM86PLUS and now is
          independed from emumodule (can also be supported by kernel patch)
	- new ./configure options:
            --enable-kernelvm86plus, --enable-novm86plus
          deleted ./configure options:
	    --enable-noemumod
	- insmod-2.1.8-HACKER_TOOL
        - 'dos -F myconfig' checked under priv_off() (closing security hole)
        From JES:
        - kill_time (select replacement) for int15
96/11/09 ver. 0.64.0.4 
	- EMM fix (Hans)
	- first round vm86plus (emumodule) (Hans)
96/10/20 ver. 0.64.0.3 
	- Priv off/on patches
	- mfs.c patch to allow PRN called from mfs drives
	- mouse.c modifed calls that reflect mouse visibility and
	  changed vectoring mouse interrupts to the actual interrupt
	  (thanks to Josef Pavlik)
	- X.c added back mouse mickeys - WP5.1 mouse works now using
	  internal driver, but not WPs ROF. Also forced mouse reset
	  on DOSEmu boot if internal mouse being used.
	  (thanks to Bernd Paysan <paysan@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>)
	- Alberto's patches to configure scripts for SBEMU.
	- Hans' patches for running on Linux 2.1.5+
96/09/24 ver. 0.64.0.2 - From Hans, SMP, emumodule, insmod and some minor DPMI-stuff
96/09/23 ver. 0.64.0.1 - JES took over some valuable patches from 0.63
96/09/18 23:06:34 From : JES - Allow compiling without X support --without-x
96/08/30 01:21:30 From: Eric -- Some more Bugfixes, and a little video cleanup practice
96/08/07 13:56:38 From : Rainer - Video / Keyboard / Misc cleanup
 * added runtime MITSHM detection
 * fixed a problem with mouse initalisation
 * mfs.c: fixed find_first error code if directory doesn't exist
96/08/02 18:45:49 From Alberto - Fix PIC bug even w/o emumodule & leave for vacations
96/08/01 22:39:10 From : JES - Minor changes to pic.[ch]
-	Not sure if these make a difference, but since I'm no C guru, it looked
	like some variable (pic_sys_time) were defined twice? At least it still
	works looking this way ;).
96/07/31 19:57:40 From Alberto - Make debug flag working again & other fixes
96/07/31 18:29:09 From : JES - More IPX fixing and a Video WorkAround
-	After all I went through to learn _not_ to call IPX functions
	directly... I turn around and do it again ;-(. Always call IPXCallRel().
96/07/31 13:57:15 From : JES - Fix IPX again ;(
96/07/31 12:03:14 From : JES - The Real Patch(tm) to bring IPX watchdog into DOSEmu
-	With many thanks to Tim Bird and JL, here is a patch to get 
	asynchronos events happening under DOSEmu. This will make DOSEmu
	nolonger dependent on the wdogfix.com TSR. The problem before was
	making a stack returnable via retf. Also added is an ESR callback
	which may give slight IPX speed inprovements (may not), but 
	prepares DOSEmu for more IPX development ;).
96/07/29 21:33:55 From Alberto - Fixed sig11 in leavedos() and cleaned some warnings

96/09/15 ******** Release 0.64.0 - Made from 0.63.50

96/07/21 09:08:21 From Alberto - patches to serial code & various stuff
96/07/21 00:51:37 From Alberto - patches to serial code to avoid reentrancy
   problems - Changes to tracing code in ports.c and dpmi.c - Some spelling
   and small bug fixes
96/07/19 22:34:50 From : kan@dcit.cz - Fixes to parsing and Dr? regs.
1) parse_config() used to check the wrong id in order to find out whether
   the user is allowed to have dangerous options in the configfile.
   Hum.. it looks like my own bug...
   (someone already fixed the same thing in parse_dosemu_users())
2) At least one program (I think it was a game--Winter Olympic Games perhaps) 
   plays with dr? registers (trying to avoid being debugged?). This problem 
   made me add some handling for mov dr??, ?? to vm86_GP_fault and make the 
   type of org_eip correct (actually, I did it in the opposite order <smile>)
96/07/10 11:26:50 From Hans: Dosdebug goes DPMI (+some minor DPMI-fixes)
96/07/07 16:13:11 From : JES - Allow stdin to be non-tty
- NO this is not the do-all-end-all to allow remote control access of DOSEmu.
  It is only a stop gap to allow some next steps in testing.

96/07/04 22:03:59 From : Kang-Lee - Misc. patches to dosemu/src/commands
After much effort and many thanks to Kang-Lee I can understand him when he says:
"Well, this patch really deserves the award of most_complicated_patch_story. :-)"
Thanks Kang-Lee ;-)
96/07/04 21:56:58 From Alberto: some goodies for DPMI, DJGPP, GUSPNP, port fixes, e.t.c.

96/06/30 12:45:11 From : Eric W. Biederman  <ebiederm@cse.unl.edu> - fixups to video, etc...
96/06/29 18:47:14 From Heiko : Reduce compiler warnings
96/06/21 13:41:27 From : Johann Friedrich Heinrichmeyer <Fritz.Heinrichmeyer@FernUni-Hagen.de> - Update SLANG
Thu Jun 27 20:11:35 1996  Eric W. Biederman  <ebiederm@cse.unl.edu>

	* Cleaned up mainy tiny things regarding font loading, screen
	resizing, and updating bios variables.  Now everything under X
	should work under X except font loading and it punts that.

	* Fixed a tiny bug where in emu-i386 where EIP was stored in a
	character.  Only important to dosdebug
	All fixes against 0.63.36
	
96/06/20 22:26:21 From : Markus Kossmann <mk@emil.inka.de> - Fix to configure.in

96/06/18 09:17:36 From Marc Nijweide (M.Nijweide@et.tudelft.nl): empty ports should return 0xff
96/06/09 15:08:29 From : Uwe - A little bit more security with port access
  doc/README.port-io: New file
  src/base/init/parser.y, etc/config.dist : New port option "device"
  src/emu-i386/cpu.c, src/emu.c, src/include/emu.h : Try to block
	multiple access to registered ports
96/06/08 16:43:13 From : JES - Allow DOSEmu to compile when no X available
96/06/08 12:28:52 From Uwe : Port Access for (L)Users
Hallo,

the patch I posted yesterday was "cut and dropped" in my editor. That way,
parts get mangled. And I didn't apply it to a clean tree, so an error
slipped by. Here is the patch against 0.63.1.30:
96/06/07 20:12:36 From JES : Reduce HMASIZE by 16 bytes as suggested by HJ
96/06/07 17:11:37 From Hans: emumodule & restore_i387; patches from Bernd
From Bernd Paysan <bernd@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>:
 -  The timer initialization in src/base/init/init.c  reduced to stay
    in 32 bit integer arithmetic.
 -  The mouse handler fakes an interrupt and pusha on the real mode stack,
    regardless if the program is in rm or pm. I added a fake_pm_int().
 -  The X_SELECTION isn't well separated from X_MOUSE. I tried to do it
    (src/env/video/X.c).

96/06/03 12:39:57 From Hans: Fix silly vm86.h include loop (oh yeah, it was my fault).
96/06/02 15:58:42 From Hans: more LDT-access rights if running root, back out old, vm86.h hack
96/05/28 21:33:31 From Hans: forbid kerneld to unload emumodule, vm86.h missing fix.
96/05/25 15:14:02 From : JES - Fix mispatch to X.c
96/05/25 14:40:32 From : Various - Many subtle patches to X-mouse, mfs, ipx ...

96/05/07 08:35:06 From Erik & Adam: Enhanced configure, Makefiles and VGAemu
96/05/02 07:21:58 From Adam Moss & Erik Mouw: MITSHM and little fixes for VGAemu
96/04/29 19:52:08 From: Alistair - Make SB (& DMA) code work
96/04/27 21:02:23 From: Alistair - SB reorganisation, DMA+SB update
96/04/26 17:11:28 From : Avery Pennarun - dosemu 0.63.1.8 X bugs (and fix)
Avery Pennarun <apenwarr@foxnet.net>
It changes env/video/X.c to use unsigned chars instead of chars for screen
cells.  Due to certain tests in the code, any character >128 (such as
line-drawing characters) would _always_ act as if that line had changed
since the last refresh.  So, in full-screen applications like Borland C++,
the flicker (and related CPU usage) was horrible.

BTW, why on earth is the "byte" typedef a signed char?

Have fun.
Avery

- I haven't tried X graphics support yet, but I made
it easy to configure in or out now.
- I think I found a bug with KERNEL_LDTALIAS in the dpmi code, plus a

- From Hans Lermen (and Kevin Buhr): Fix for timerlock-bug

  This includes the patch from Kevin Buhr (good work),
  plus some fixes to make hardware-IRQs work (Sillyint),
  plus some other pic fixes (correct now, but wasn't the reason for the lock)
  plus THE (one line) fix for the _real_ bug:

    Once again we messed up with VIF flag, hence letting ints pass
    through. even if CLI was active.
    This apparently was one 'bug-catcher' we left back during the
    the great hunt for 'the bug of bugs' some month ago.
    (Hmm... I say 'we', but very well may be that it was 'me') 

  I also introduced a
    #define USE_UNIX_TIME_FOR_INT1A_AH0
  which should be defined at top of dosemu/int.c to get the 'old' code,
  which does not use the BIOS 40:6c timer, but got the time from Linux
  and overwrites 40:6c.
  Currently it is not defined, so INT1A AH=0 gets time from 40:6c,
  however, if somone gets 'timerlocks' again (which I don't hope),
  then try witch defineing USE_UNIX_TIME_FOR_INT1A_AH0 and report to the
  team.

- From WE Metzenthen <billm@euler.maths.monash.edu.au>
Hi,
   Having some dos stuff which I wanted to run, I decided that it was
time to update my dosemu.  Unfortunately, I still only run a mono HGA
card so dosemu-0.60.3 was not a stunning success.  Anyway, I dug into
the sources to the extent which was necessary to get it to work with
my HGA card and the resulting patches are attached to the end of this
message.  The patches also improve the functionality in that dosemu
now does something more sensible with the cursor.

   Not having followed the development of dosemu closely, I don't
claim that these patches represent the correct way to solve the
problems, only that they work for me under admittedly limited testing.

   The patches also apply cleanly to dosemu-0.60.4.3 (apart from a
trivial Makefile change) and seem to compile o.k., but I haven't
checked the result because I don't want to bother with modules yet.

--Bill

Tue Oct 03	1995

- From: "Pavel Kankovsky" <KAN@frode.dcit.cz>
These my patches are against 0.60.3 (but they seem to still be
usable in 0.61.00 from what I have seen at the first glance).
Here is some description only (usable as ChangeLog entries, I hope),
diffs themselves are enclosed as attached files (dosemu[0-3].diff).

Patch 0 fixes 3 things in mfs.c:
- Mktime() uses tm_isdst value (unlike stated in the original source code)
  leaving it unset causes random mtime shifts by one hour and has funny
  effects esp. when running make, value -1 (which meaning is "figure out
  the proper value yourself" :> ) seems to be the best one for me.
- Hlist stack management was quite 'kludge-o-matic' in the original code
  and caused problems with Quattro Pro 5.0 installation program which 
  starts a directory search, does NOT finish it and spawns unzip program 
  that starts another directory search, and upon unzip's exit, both lists 
  were popped, making the installation die eventually.
  I rewrote findfirst/next and hlist_push/pop to allow this case and
  do it all in a bit cleaner way.
- Findfirst returns FILE_NOT_FOUND no more because original Dos returns 
  this value only for EMPTY directories (even no ., .., volume label!),
  so NO_MORE_FILES is more convenient in most cases (esp. for Volkov 
  Commander -- Norton Cmdr. alike -- that used to complain "Can't read 
  volume in drive X:" every time it got FILE_NOT_FOUND for findfirst)

Patch 1 brings some improvement I made in dosdbg.c and its counterpart
dyndeb.c to help myself when examining PIC working. The original code
does not accept debug levels (as Dosemu command line options do). Now
you can do something like "dosdbg 3r" when Dos boots and reduce the 
debugging log by cca 300 kilobytes. :-)

Patch 2 makes Dosemu safer as it does not allow ordinary users to do
"dos -F ..." with dangerous (e.g. direct disk access) settings in their 
configfiles.

Patch 3 modifies keyboard driver finalization so as to let keyboard leds
follow in-kernel num/caps/scroll-lock flags again. (I was trying to make
it save led-function setting and restore it later but the kernel does not 
seem to provide a straight-forward way of doing it. Bad luck.)

I hope it will help make Dosemu better Dos than Dos! :-)

Mon Oct 02	1995

-	Patches to XMS for better himem compatibility

Wed Oct 11 22:28:05 1995  John Kohl  <jtk@pattern.arlington.ma.us>

	* Update for latest NetBSD stuff

Wed Sep 27	1995

-	Included many patches to get NetBSD back on track.
-	Added in 2 patches for debugger and other en-Hans-ments :-)

Tue Sep 12	1995

-	Added first layer of DMA and SoundBlaster code oringinally
	contributed by Joel Weber (age 15), then put into the
	distribution by Alistair.

Sat Sep 09	1995

-	Added FOSSIL internal support by 
	pasi@forum.nullnet.fi (Pasi Eronen)
-	Added X enhancments and -O option by 
	Uwe Bonnes bon@elektron.ikp.physik.th-darmstadt.de and Pasi.
-	Hans' latest syscallmgr updates.

Thu Jul 28	1995

-	Release DOSEMU-0.60.4.tgz
-	Hans' patch to dpmi.c
-	Added CLTS from rde@tadpole.co.uk (Richard Evans)
-	Added .ini extensions from Jon
-	From Snow Cat
2) pic/pic.c has some assembler code that doesn't work with -O3 because it's
using global labels that get expanded more than once. Fixing it to use local
labels solves the problem.

3) mfs/mfs.c  doesn't handle "commit file" and  "flush all disk  buffers".  It
causes AH=68H/int 21H to return an error code that confuses database programs.
I  changed COMMIT_FILE to do fsync()  and  FLUSH_ALL_BUFFERS to do nothing and
return success (because sync()ing every time DOS wants  to flush buffers makes
too much noise).
.... and some other patches too.

-	Mfs patch from Andi.
-	Mouse patches from beck@informatik.hu-berlin.de (Michael Beck)
-	Patches for UID settings by Steven P. Crain

Wed Jun 28	1995

-	Release DOSEMU-0.60.3.tgz

From Hans :
This is a summary of my changes since dosemu0.60.2:

-       Upgraded syscallmgr/insmod to modutils-1.2.8
        (full insmod-tree is in insmod-1.2.8-HACKER_TOOL.tar.gz)
        Now can (mix) load  a.out- or ELF- modules  into  
        a.out- or ELF- kernels.
-       New LDT support for emumodule, now can access the *real* LDT
        from dosemu user space. How it works can be seen in ldttest.c
-       Made emumod ELF compilable
        ( patch from Rick Sladkey <jrs@world.std.com> )
-       Took over some changes to vm86() from Linux 1.2.11 and 1.3.3
        into emumodule. Also now doing full verify_area on all accessed
        user space in emumodules' vm86() (USE_VM86_STACKVERIFY).
        This fixes some odd DOS register messups.
-       Fixed wrong flag handling in bios.S for INT10 .. INT1B
        (some of them should IRET).
-       Improved return to DOS-space from dosemu redirected INTs
        int dosemu/int.c function do_int().
        (did respawn to dosemu immediately, so leaving the DOSapp
         no chance to react).
-       Fixed interruption of DOS space when interrupts were disabled.
        ( check for VIF at entry of pic's run_irqs() ).
        This fixes the main trouble together with sillyint (exception 6 bug).
        JES did the rest by finding this damned WRITE_FLAGS bug and
        fixing various VIF/IF handling.
-       Now dosemu will do register dump if -g debugflag is set and
        if killed via SIGHUP. So we can see were the DOSapp is hanging.
-       Varous fixing for sillyint (SIG), so it now complies with the
        new pic-handling.
-       Fix startup recognition of loaded emumodule. Now it will exit
        with error if no module is loaded and REQUIRES_EMUMODULE is set.
-       Made dosemu/sigsegv.c real-mode-386-compatible and fixed wrong
        prefix handling (ES,DS,GS,FS,REP).
        Moved some remaining 'fprintf(stderr)' to 'i_printf()'
-       Fixed overload condition resulting in DOS internal stack overflow.
        (<ESC> bug while using SLANG terminal). This is done by monitoring
        the difference between pic_sys_time and pic_dos_time and avoiding
        vm86() respawning to fast when OVERLOAD_THRESHOULD is reached.
        This way DOS has a better chance to catch up some additional
        CPU time in order to be in schedule with pic_sys_time.
-       Fixed dualmon messup (didn't work a lot of last releases).

So long,
Hans

programs to DOSEMU to execute.

Basics:

Passing a command to DOSEMU:
============================
	dos -E "command to be passed to DOSEMU" ....
	....
	C:\> unix.exe -e
  	>> RUNS command to be passed to DOSEMU <<

Executing the contents of an UNIX Environment Variable:
=======================================================
	C:\> unix.exe -e ENV_VAR_NAME
	>> RUNS COMMAND NAMED IN env_var_name <<

  NB ENV_VAR_NAME will probably need to be in CAPITALS !

Running a UNIX Command:
=======================
  (As Before...)
	C:\ unix.exe ls -l /dev
	>> RUNS "ls -l /dev" under Linux .... <<

James,

Well, I restarted the patch work that I sent to you some time ago.  I
haven't gotten all the way through it yet (sadly), but here goes:

I propose a naming convention for the initialization procedures:

   xxxx_init()       for something that only gets called once
   xxxx_setup()      for something that gets called at each 'reboot'
                     (e.g. internal reboot -- the code that doesn't work)

-	Dualmon patches from (mouw@morra.et.tudelft.nl> (Erik Mouw)
-	Rewritten unix.c to compile under various DOS C-compilers.

Mon Jan	 30	1995

-	Must mention that JL has added an interrupt watchdog
	timer so that the keyboard behind problem may be resolved.
-	Backed out Marty's exchange_uids() as they were slightly
	incomplete and causing video switching (etc) problems.

-	Renamed termio.* to keyboard.c. Attempted to move all
	keyboard functions into the keyboard subdir.

-	Well, for better or worse, watch out world, I've started
	back again on some of the client/server aspect. Remeber
	that :-)? At this time, dosemu now creates a file:
	/tmp/dosemu.<PID> with basic info and SHM id's. To
	see how amazing this is (pun is intended!), 
	cd clients and make. Then you'll have 2 programs:
	video - To just dump the dos processes 80x25 video screen
		(Must NOT be in graphics or console mode)
	keyboard - To dump what is in the DOSEMU keyboard buffer.
		   (NOT the DOS 40:?? buffer)
	Both programs require a pid as parrameter 1.

Fri Jan	 20	1995

-	Additions by Denis Julitovto make ctrl-alt-del stuff work.

Fri Jan	 16	1995

-	Release pl40
-	Upsetting the DPMI apple cart during testing of timer.exe. Now
	the following rules have been applied with hacking :
	1) calls to realmode procedures do NOT run handle_signals() so
	   that DPMI properly deals with them upon return.
	2) hardware int's are first reflected to the possible
	   protected mode interrupt handle, which may (and usually 
	   does) reflect them back to the realmode handler.

Fri Jan	 13	1995

-	Added Alan's mouse patches
-	Added Scotts big patch to make int.c and move signals into signal.c
-	Small patch to bios_emm.c so that seg -> phy requests are properly
	handled.
Mon Jan  9	1995

-	Small change to EMS so that Allocate pages allows allocation
	of 0 pages. This allows Windows 3.0 to run small EMS frame.
-	Scott has brought garrot into DOSEMU :).
- 	Got Hans's ./tools/sh.kversion to work. sorry Hans.
-	beck@informatik.hu-berlin.de Michael Beck
	Here it comes. The patch is very stupid, and add the classname XDosEmu
	when dosemu runs with X-Support. Use fvwm's ICON "XDosEmu"
	to get the icon.
	BTW, perhaps someone should change the config-parsing, so instead of
	the Iconname the user can set the classname.

Sun Jan  8 	1995

-	Released pre0.53_39
-	All Hans' patches to get a working kversion.h system in place.
	Finally we can easily(?) keep dosemu working with various
	releases.
-	From Alan:

	Hi James,

		I saw in the code you've been doing a bit of hacking with 2/3 button
	mice. Well I modified a bit of the code and hope this helps a little.

		What I've done is provided switchable PC Mouse/Microsoft mice modes
	within DOSEMU. I've re-written mouse.S to become mouse.asm (Sorry, I couldn't
	suss out gas to compile dos progs, so I had to use a86). Anyway I've also
	provided the NEW ! raw mouse.com at the end of this message in uuencoded
	format.

		There have been a few more subtle changes to the code that you'll
	probably notice too. One of the more obvious, is that the internaldriver
	now can have 3 button emulation on 2 button mice. 

		Anyway MOUSE.COM now takes some arguments...

			r - resets the iret. Put "mouse r" in your autoexec now..
			i - inquire current configuration of mouse driver.
			p - Set PC Mouse mode (3 buttons)
			m - Set Microsoft mode (2 buttons)

	I'll be implementing more as we go along...

	Some of the PS/2 Mouse BIOS routines have been deleted/re-written, as the
	existing code was wrong.

	Alan.

	Hi again.

		Some more fixes.

		Apparently according to my documentation there are some wrong doings
	in the show/hide stuff. There should be a counter which if 0 the cursor shows,
	but it is possible to do ... hide(), hide() which will make the counter -2,
	then doing a show() with put the counter at -1, but will still not show the
	cursor. Doing another show() will make the cursor appear.

-	Alan's patches to get Hans' emumod system compiling again.
-	Added new lredir.exe and lredir.c from Tim Josling <tej@melbpc.org.au>:

	The problems fixed are:

	Doesn't check that argv[2] exists before using it, causing a loop in some
	cases.

	Function that returns nothing is specified to return some type of int,
	causing compiler complaints.

	Drive mounted read-only is reported as read-write.

	I tested the fixes pretty thoroughly so they shoudl be OK. I compiled
	with Turbo C++ 3.0 when I tested them.

	The file below is the full source in dos format (with ^M's). I tried to
	generate a diff file but this didn't work as the original file didn't
	have the ^M's on many lines so as my editer put them on every line I
	ended up with many spurious diff's.

	The version of lredir was the one from 0.53pl37.

	Regards,
	Tim Josling

-	Added Lutz's latest DPMI patches. GO32 now runs and shows
	memory. Some go32 DPMI programs are running. Yah Lutz.

Wed Jan  4 	1995

-	Released pre0.53_38. Happy New Year.
-	Added Marty's next set of patches.
-	Moved Hans' enhancements form 'make doeverything' to
	'make itall' so that as kernels change, make doeverything
	remains OK.
-	Jiggled around where ioctl's to acquire_vt were in vc.c in
	an effort to stop more of the VC switch hanging bug.

Tue Jan  3 	1995

-	Added Marty's Unix.exe to send unix commands from DOSEMU.
	To use, just ln files to a unix.exe that you wish to run. 
	I.E:
	 ln ./commands/unix.exe ls.exe
	 from within dosemu, just enter ls and the ls command is executed.
-	Added two parms to call to show_reg( __FILE__, __LINE__) to
	track down where show_regs() are being called from.

Sun Jan  1 	1995

-	Added return to getKey() function in ./keyboard/termio.c when
	screen is not current. Fixed screen lockups here.
-	Removed (added #if 0) code setting bs_pos to -1 for root dir deletes

Mon Dec  19	1994

-	Added Marty's latest Makefile enhancements. This included 2 new
	files (data.c extern.h) and including int.h inside of
	emu.c. Marty promises emu.c will get smaller :-)
-	Added Lutz's latest DPMI enhancements.

Sun Dec  11	1994

-	Changed check for mouse in graphics mode by using video
	regs.
-	Latest updates from BOCHS project.
-	Modified MICKEY concept in mouse.c so that WordPerfect now
	works with internal mouse. Doing this blind folks. Anxiously
	waiting for Alan's next set of mouse enhancements.

Tue Jan  3 09:49:22 1995  Jochen Hein (Hein@Informatik.TU-Clausthal.de)

	* keyboard layout gr renamed to de, like keyboard-utils.

Fri Dec  9	1994

-	Release pl37
-	Added garrot02 to dosemu. I think it should be separate on 
	tsx?

Sat Dec  3	1994

-	Update to add different X fonts :

	Hi!

	I just added support to change the font used with XDOS.  There is a new
	keyword, "font", in the X-section of the config file which allows you to
	specify the font to be used.  If the font is not a monospaced font (or can't
	be found) "vga" is still the default.

	There is no translation done, i.e. the font has to be an IBM font!

	So, if someone wants to create a smaller font...

	BTW, the include file "linux/segment.h" changed to "asm/segment.h" somewhere
	around linux 1.1.67 (it is used in dpmi.c).

	The diffs are against pre0.53pl36.

-	Release pl36.

Mon Nov  28     1994

-	Added -D__ASSEMBLY__ to get emumodule.o going again in
	later kernels :-).
-	Some problem in RPT_SYSCALL, so went back to SA_RESTART and
	set RPT_SYSCALL to return.
-	Added mouse.com which causes int33 to be redirected away from
	an iret. Now Foxpro mouse works in X, but still no WPO :(.

Sun Nov  27     1994

-	Major -(Thats MAJOR)- restructure of the directories and 
	dosemu files. Marty is a busy man.

-	Verified alt keys are working well, as well as alternate
	slang keys.
-	Latest memory access for cross-platform development thanks
	to Kevin for the Bochs team.

Tue Nov  21     1994

-	Added RPT_SYSCALL's to some writes. Kinda kludgy for know :-(
-	Latest SLANG enhancements:
Hi,

   I added the ability to access ALT, SHIFT, and CONTROL keys for remote
terminals.  For example, one can now use alt function keys as well as
Ctrl-Backspace, Shift-tab to get the backtab, Ctrl-Arrow, etc....

   Below, you will find a uuencoded file called `files.tar.gz'.  After
unpacking it, you will see:  termio.c, slang-termio.c, and terminal.c.slang.
The latter files should go in the `video' subdir and the other two go in the
`keyboard' subdir.  `termio.c' is exactly like the one already there.  The
changes are marked by `#ifdef USE_SLANG' stuff.

   Note that in slang-termio.c, you will find 3 global variables:
   
static char *Alt_Shiftkey = "^@A";
static char *Ctrl_Shiftkey = "^@C";
static char *Shift_Shiftkey = "^@S";

These should be initialized by the user by whatever mechanism you prefer.
They represent the keysequence that invokes the appropriate modifier key,
e.g., to get the next key ALT, press `Ctrl-@ A'.  Perhaps, it might be
easier to simply use `Ctrl-A' but I wanted to demonstrate that one can use a
multiple character key sequence.  When one of these keys are pressed, an
indicator will appear at the bottom of the screen indicating this. (The new
terminal.c.slang does this).

I had a terrible time getting the ESC key timout to work properly at 2400
baud.  As a result, I have eliminated the ESC timeout from the slang
version.  If you want to send an ESC, hit it twice.  The alternative simply
does not work and hitting it twice when an escape is needed is alot less
painful.  One can always rebind the escape key on the terminal emulator to
send two escapes.

Obviously, we will want to add some mechanism to rebind keys.  I do not
believe that relying on the keys as defined in termcap is adequate.  For
example, one might want to rebind Ctrl-E to escape for a DOS program that
uses the ESC alot.

-	Added ctrl-enter to Xkeyb thanks to Veijo Vilva 
	<vilva@xiron.pc.helsinki.fi>

Sat Nov  19     1994

-	Latest terminal.c from John Davis.

Fri Nov  18     1994

-	Patch for PS/2 mice from Keith Parks <keithp@its.bt.co.uk>.
-	Slang code replacement in test. Set USE_SLANG in Makefile.
	Slang is a faster terminal control library than ncurses.
	Requires slang (amy.tch.harvard.edu in pub/slang , or tsx
	in the dosemu Development subdir). Many thanks to
	John Davis (davis@amy.tch.harvard.edu) for trying to
	win us over.
-	Patches to /init/parser.y for /etc/dosemu.users.

Wed Nov  16     1994

-	Rod May has noted that due to race conditions in the kernel
	during partition access in kernels in the 1.1.51 - 1.1.61 and
	I believe 1.1.63. Don't have his E-mail here, but it DOES
	CAUSE CORRUPTION and therefore BEWARE of using PARTITION
	ACCESS in these kernels!
-	First steps towards making DOSEMU platform independant by
	the Boch's project, Kevin P. Lawton" <bochs@max.tiac.net>.
-	JL's latest bios.S. Cleaned up and documented.
-	Latest Makefile, DPMI, etc cleanups. Moving towards a
	Makefile.common system.

Sat Nov  12	1994

- Release pre0.53_33.
- Han's latest, now he has a self-contained emumodule that includes
  SIG and really gives DOSEMU the power it has desired for quite some
  time to make use of the kernel. You will need to set the #if 0 to 1
  in emu.h as well as:
  /* From Hans: If you you need the emumodules special features
   * You also must load the modules as follows:
   *   login in as root
   *   cd /usr/src/dosemuXXX/syscallmgr
   *   ./insmod syscallmgr.o
   *   ./insmod -m ../emumod/emumodule.o
   */

More background:

Hi Jim

As you didn't show up at IRC, I send you some explanations about the
new emumodule stuff and inbedded sillyint.

I established two interfaces to the emumodule, which I think can be
expanded for all other features, that we need in the future:

1. A standard Linux systemcall (over syscallmgr) for all
   functions that needs the kernel support functions (like printk).
   During within this syscall, the scheduler and/or an interrupt
   may take away control from dosemu.
   The calling convention of this syscal is defined in
   ./include/emusys.h as
       extern inline int emusyscall(int mode, int params)
   and can be called at this time as

   result = emusyscall(EMUSYS_GETVERSION,0);
   result = emusyscall(EMUSYS_GETSUPPORT,0);
   result = emusyscall(EMUSYS_REQUEST_IRQ,irqnum);
   result = emusyscall(EMUSYS_FREE_IRQ,irqnum);
   
2. I implemented a so called fast syscall via an INT 0xe6 to Linux
   (not to DOS).
   This syscall has not the great overhead that the standard syscall
   has and can't be interrupted by Linux's scheduler or interrupts.
   With this we can access kernel space much faster then with kmem
   or other techniques and also we can set some bits of emumodules
   variable. We can check some status, and after return from
   fastsyscall we are shure that the status is what it says.
   Its also possible to realized some of the DPMI functions with
   this kind of syscall.
   But, this syscall must run with interrupts disabled, and also
   can only use some the kernels macros, but not the support functions
   which leads to rescheduling e.t.c.
   I used this type of syscall to get and reset the IRQ-bits of
   sillyint.
   Also the fastsys calls are defined in ./include/emusys.h and
   currently there exists:

   extern inline int fastsyscall(int mode) /* generic call */
   extern inline int get_and_reset_irq(int irqnum)
   extern inline int get_and_set_irq(int irqnum)
   extern inline int get_irq_bits(void)

To enable dosemu to use the new features there must be REQUIRES_EMUMODULE
defined in emu.h (see at the comments at top of this file).
If it is not defined, sillyint is used as usual.

One thing at last: I always are on war with "make", so please check
and change the Makefiles, that they do compile emumod/ and syscallmkgr/
if REQUIRES_EMUMODULE is set. I was to silly to do so.
I also would like to do make from the subdirectories directly during
devellopment phase.

...Ah, and the patch fits into 0.53.32 with dualmon.patch already in.

So long
Hans
<lermen@elserv.ffm.fgan.de>

-  Small patch to ./mouse/mouse.c which resets the initiated mouse
   subroutine on calls to fnx 0x21. This previously wasn't reset and
   caused future programs to crash DOSEMU when they loaded over that
   space. Now to see why some programs (Foxpro/Word Perfect Office) 
   don't recognize the internal mouse driver :-(.

Wed Nov  9	1994

-	Various patches from lee@tengu.in-berlin.de (Kang-Jin Lee) to
	makefiles.

- From Hans :
#   - If you have a dual-monitor configuration (e.g. MDA as second display),
#     you then may run CAD programs on 2 displays or let play your debugger
#     on the MDA while debugging a graphics program on the VGA (e.g TD -do ).
#     You also may switch to the MDA display by using the DOS command
#     mode mono (mode co80 returns to your normal display).
#     This feature can be enabled by the switch "dualmon" like this:
#       video { vga  console  graphics dualmon }
#     and can be used on a xterm and the console, but of course not, if you
#     have the MDA as your primary display.
#     You also must set USE_DUALMON 1 in include/video.h.
#     NOTE: Make shure no more then one process is using this feature !
#           ( you will get funny garbage on your MDA display. )
#           Also, you must NOT have the dualmon-patches for kernel applied
#           ( having the MDA as Linux console )
#

-	From Rob May:
Hi James!
        yep, this is an interesting point. It's not just lilo that will
have problems, some other boot sector programs (which rewrite the MBR)
will need this "workaround" and therefore won't work with this patch.
(I would recommend using one of the newer boot sector programs as they
are better than lilo, but this is a different point).
        Unfortunately this "workaround" is a very poor long term
solution, as using the current part-table is the only safe option.
This only affects people who boot using DPA with lilo up their MBR, but...
Since we are basically hacking the part-table to only one valid bootable
partition, a solution is to cut out the middle-man and boot the partition
directly, this way we get the current part-table and whatever boot
sector code you have is irrelevant. Patch to emu.c follows....
        Any Comments?

From: Rod May <stoke@melbourne.DIALix.oz.au>
Hi there,
	here's a patch (to pl28) which makes the use of "mkpartition" 
unnecessary for direct partition access. Also the partition number is no
longer required. i.e. instead of specifying:
	disk { partition "/dev/hda3" 3 }  and running "mkpartition",
you only have to specify:
	disk { partition "/dev/hda3" }
The MBR is read from the appropriate hard drive during start-up.
Not only does this simplyfy things but stops potential mistakes
including: out of date MBRs, specifying hda instead of hda3 etc. 
These were not flagged before and could lead to "interesting" results. 
Using the old format will get you a config warning but otherwise
the partition number will just be ignored,

Hope this patch is useful, next effort might be read_sectors() which
needs a bit of work!
		bye for now,

Hi Jes -

Here is the new pic code.  It is implemented as contidional code, so you'll
have to un-comment a line in the Makefile if you want to try it.
Look for the string NEW_PIC in the Makefile; the instructions are right
before it.

Because the serial.c pic mods don't work very well yet, I have provided
two options:  The firstone only implements pic for keyboard and timer code.
This stuff is pretty solid, and I would appreciate bug reports, etc.
The second option implements pic for timer, keyboard, and serial interrupts.
The serial code is knows to have bugs, although it is useable.  PLEASE,
if all you know is that the serial code doesn't work right, DON'T send
a bug report.  I already know that much :-).  On the other hand, if you have
a fix, or even just a partial one, please let me know.  The serial bug
shows as an extermely low send rate; only half as fast as whennot using pic.

I would appreciate any bug reports on the keyboard and timer code.  They are 
not complete, but I believe this code to be bug-free.

And now, a (very) little technical information for the curious:

There are two big differences when using pic.  First, interrupts are not
queued beyond a depth of 1 for each interrupt.  It is up to the interrupt
code to detect that further interrupts are required and reschedule itself.
Second, interrupt handlers are designated at dosemu initialization time.
Triggering them involves merely specifying the appropriate irq.

Since timer interrupts are always spaced apart, the lack of queueing has no
effect on them.  The keyboard interrupts are re-scheduled if there is
anything in the scan_queue.  The keyboard pseudo-input register,
*LASTSCAN_ADD, is set to 1 (an otherwise unused value) to indicate that it
has been read, and can therefore be re-filled.  Both the keyboard and timer
bios routines now have outb 0x20 to signal the EOI.  The OUTB_ADDR is no
longer used.

This has been slow in coming, I know; and it will be a while before it gets
fully utilized.  But, at least when the serial code gets done, it should
help get dpmi on its way.  I'll keep working on this; I think it has a lot
of potential to help organize the code.  Good luck with it to all, and
thanks in advance for any comments.
-	Mods to Makefile, xinstallvgafont, xterm
-	pktnew.c uses run_int() instead of do_hard_int()
-	Various Makefile mods
-	Latest syscallmgr and emumodule from Hans. Remember the
	insmod -m switch
-	dosnet subdir now v-net. Hey, why not :-).
-	Added 'make optionalsubdirs' to keep new test stuff out of
	make most. 
-	Patches received to allow logical partitions to work with partition
	access. All that is required is to have partition parm to
	disk statement be higher than 4.

Tue Oct 18 1994 JES

-	Added config.pd and -D+P debug switch for packet driver debugging

Sun Oct 16 1994 JES

Hi there!
        Here's my patch for allowing DPA access to specific logical
partitions under dosemu. It applies to the patch level 27 code of
disks.[ch].
        Access to specfic logical partitions, rather than entire
extended partitions, is a great idea for the same reason that partition
access is better than wholedisk access: one day a poor linux
partition will suffer. Its used by specifying a part number greater
than 4  e.g.:
        disk { partition "/dev/hda5" 5 }
the number itself does mot matter (as long as its greater than 4) as it
is the device name that's used to derive the part table entry info.
The only query is that I raised the MAX_HDISKS in disk.h from 4 to 8,
(I'm using 7 at the moment with no probems). Also I wasn't sure of the
number to pass to leavedos for the BLKGETSIZE error, is there a
convention for this?
        This should never never happen though (famous last words).
        Hope this is useful to others,
        email me with any questions,

                        Ciao,
                                Rod May.

	-	#if 0'ed Warnings for running static in dos.c

Fri Oct 14 1994 JES

-	Release pre53_27.tgz
-	Small patch to int10.c so that recursive calls to char_out()
	for tab's doesn't become and endless loop :-(
-	Patch from Dino Dini to get that -F option working again.
-	Patch to emu.c to make clean compiles without X.
-	Added adder var to timer code so that 2 reads don't return
	the same number.
-	More I'm sure... But I forget :-(.

Mon Oct 10 1994 JES

-	vinod@cse.iitb.ernet.in (Vinod G Kulkarni) has added multiple
	protocal/sessions under DOSEMU via dosnet (dsn0) device. Requires
	reading of ./dosnet/dosnet.README, loading the dosnet.o module,
	ifconfig'ing it with a new IP, and running ipxbridge (ipxbridge0.1).


Sat Oct 07 1994 JES

-	andi@andiunx.m.isar.de (Andreas Kies) added the catch for 
	keystate to HogThreshold. Seems to be a great help for keeping
	CPU usage down.

Fri Oct 07 1994 JES

-	Removed SIGIO for PS2 and busmice.

Wed Oct 05 1994 JES

-	Even better Configure script from Jan.
-	Diffs from Martin.
-	Changed Extended Move Block call in xms.c to not move outside
	(from/to) of valid memory.

Tue Oct 04 1994 JES

-	pre53_26 released.
-	Added in some timer code from MACH for Scott to play with.
	NOTE ****** This is scary stuff so beware of this release
	as the code WILL get direct access of certain ports :-(.
	You may wish to hold off until pre53_27.
-	Latest Configure script from Jan. Keeps getting better, and
	funner too :-).
-	Added Hans latest SIG enhancements.

Mon Oct 03 1994 Lutz

-	Placed back DPMI sigio/sigalrm signal calls to the old one ;-(
-	Removed dpmi/call.S - now using a task switch via hlt-instruction
-	Fixed some small DPMI bugs

Sun Oct 02 1994 Jmaclean

-	Released pre53_25.
-	Added 10 bytes to the malloc for 1 dir_ent struct, as the
	dir_emt size seems too small. This fixes some bad mfs.c bugs.
-	Added a nonl() by request of Fons Botman <NE3995!botman@relay.NL.net>.

Fri Sep 30 1994 Jmaclean

-	Released pre53_24.
-	Added Scott's patch to fix EMS attempting to access invalid
	memory. Fastest fix for a bug I've seen :-).
-	Modified CHECK_HANDLE to deal with non-active handles as it
	was previously just checking for ranges. This fixes Hans
	finding of mem/d giving extraneous info.
-	Moved Lutz's DPMI signal calls to within the signals for Hans.

Wed Sep 28 1994 Jmaclean

-	Fixed one definite place for Divide/Stack Overflow to occur in int.h.
	Problem occured when a default interrupt was called by a redirected
	interrupt. This caused a recursion to the never lands.

Tue Sep 27 1994 Jmaclean

-	Released pre53_23.tgz in diff form only.
-	Added Jan's latest Configure script with X support. Modified
	it to cp with backups /etc/dosemu.conf to /etc/dosemu.conf.backup.
-	Remade first part of convascii of termio.c where esc seq's
	are translated. Involved working around select getting 
	interrupted.
-	Fixs to serial woes added in termio.c - keyboard_init().
	Moral of this story? A baud rate of 0 (B0) is equivalent to 
	sending the process -SIGHUP. Real fix added to ./video/terminal.c
	by moving raw() statement to AFTER initscr() as spec'd in ncurses.
-	Fixed to memory access errors in vga.c. Funny they seem to have
	been OK when handled in a signal?. Now folks should be able to
	resume switching VC's :-).

Mon Sep 26 1994 Jmaclean

-	Pre53_22.tgz released.
-	Added isemu.com from dan@fch.wimsey.bc.ca (Dan Fandrich) to give a
	return code for testing if DOSEMU is running.
-	Added MDA as valid card selection in dosemu.conf (=MGA)
-	Some goodies from Hans Lerman:

Well, here now is the summery of things that are in my patches which
I have tested under Linux-1.1.50.
( the patches come in a separate mail, because my mailer cannot handle
too large mails )

1. Loadable driver sillyint.o
   It is compiled via a normal "make doeverything"
   and put into the directory /boot/modules.
   I changed the sig/Makefile, it also needs to know where the kernel
   sources are (USRSRCDIR).
   The source needs a -DMAKE_LOADABLE_DRIVER to compile sillyint.o
   The same source can be used (without the -DMAKE..) to compile the
   kernel linked in driver. I changed the sig/HowTo.

   The device major is put into an global variable SIG_MAJOR, so it
   can be changed on loadtime by
     insmod /boot/modules SIG_MAJOR=31


2. Multiple SIG IRQ's can be defined in /etc/dosemu.conf and
   also wether to use SIGIO or not. (see examples/config.dist)
   Because of "sillint off", there is no need to disable SIG
   via compile time option SIG. I recommend to let it be #define SIG 1.
   I did not succeed with setting up a test for two IRQs at the same time,
   so me and other people have to test it in the future.


3. Mapping of hardware ram is configurable via

     hardware_ram { 0xc8000 }  # one 4K page mapped
   or
     hardware_ram { 0xc8000 range 0xcc000 0xcffff }  # multiple mapped pages

   I added an overlap test to avoid wrong mapping, it is done after
   configuration is finished, so it should catch all errors.
   It relates to EMS, VBIOS and HARDWARE_RAM.


4. EMS-frame is now movable (needed for ram conflicts).
   The ems keyword is expanded as follows:
     ems { 1024 ems_frame 0xe000}
   or
     ems { ems_size 1024 }  # defaults to old size of 0x10000

   But the old syntax is valid too.


5. Size of VBIOS now configurable (most BIOSes at 0xc0000 have only 32K
      so I can gain some space for hardware ram and/or UMBs).
      /etc/dosemu.conf line:
        added flag "vbios_size"


6. I corrected a situation (not a bug) concerning the "c" debug flag.
   If "c" was switched off in /etc/dosemu.conf, you could not get
   the config printout via
     dos -D+c
   Now this is possible.



That's all for now, ...so long,
Hans

Sat Sep 24 1994 Jmaclean

-	Messed more with timer interrupt so that setting date backwards
	doesn't cause divide overflow. Seems to fix it for going
	ahead and back through time. Only problem is that when DOS
	sees it's past 24hrs, it always moves its date ahead a day :-(.
-	Changed config.graphics to config.vga in emu.c to control 
	setting allowvideoportaccess to 0.
-	Added vc switching (set_process_control) to new signal_queue.
	From conversation with JL I'm not sure this is gonna be solid
	since now the signal_queue being run to switch VC's will rely
	on returns from vm86().
	Still doesn't fix bad crashing when running Windows3.0 which
	takes down my whole UNIX box :-(.
-	Stopped DOSEMU from exiting when no diskette in drive.
-	Added note to add users to /etc/dosemu.users in QuickStart.
-	Fixed parsing of -C option to NOT expect arguements.

Thr Sep 22 1994 Jmaclean

-	PRE53_21 Released.
-	Messed with timer code. Changed tick setting to different
	method and relied on time() to give acurate time.
	Found what seems to be the 24 hour bug and inilated it!!!!!!
	With many thanks to Corey.
-	Added backspace/delete patch to Xkeyb.c. Thanks to Scott and Mark.
-	Hacked up HogThreshold again. Rule: Closer you set to 0, the
	lower the CPU usage. At 0 though, hogThreshold is turned off,
	and int16/int2a are run full open.
-	Added HogThreshold to int2a.
-	Added patches to bring -F config file option back to life
	thanks to Dino Dini <ddini@dircon.co.uk>.
-	Added patches to ./video/X.c for better color reps thanks
	to Mark.
-	Prepared to move vc_acquire/release under new signal
	handling... but failed miserably :-(.
-	Makefile additions by Mark.

Tue Sep 20 1994 Jmaclean

-	Removed most coding from SIGIO and SIGALRM signals in an
	effort to remove race conditions. Now these signals just
	mark that they've occured, save their context, and 
	continue. Lutz's DPMI will suffer :-(. Probably best to 
	go through DANG to get an idea of what's going on :-).

Mon Sep 19 1994 Jmaclean

-	Wrapped lpt opens in exchange_uids() to allow "lpr" to run at
	user level.
-	Modified Makefile to create libdosemu$(EMUVER)pl$(PATCHL) and link
	libdosemu to it. Now folks can compare releases just by changing
	symlinks. Probably not what was wanted, but a close facsimile :-).
-	Added SIG mods by Hans Lermen (lermen@elserv.ffm.fgan.de). More to
	come.
-	Cleaned up boot() in emu.c to just boot. Added memory_init() for
	all specific memory setups for proper i86 boots.
-	Added portuguese keyboard map.

Sun Sep 18 1994 Jmaclean

-	Removed ioc_fd and replaced all occurances with kbd_fd.
-	Started DANGing :-).

fri Sep 16 1994 Jmaclean

-	Another change to the readonly open error
-	Fix to mfs.c for return values for readonly mfs drives.

Sat Sep 10 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added new dialog script from Jan Vandenburge.

-	Fixed internal Mouse driver not setting up for new SIGIO calls. 
	Thanks to Alan for providing a fix... But  I  did  it ...
	my  way  :-). Hope you don't mind Alan.

-	Fixed SERIAL not working. Martin's code was returning in
	outb before anything was done :-(.

-	And now a little from Alan...:

Hi James..

	Not my usual stuff but I had to fix it.

	The parser seemed to be screwed up for me, in that it parsed two
files, both the local .dosrc and the /etc/dosemu.conf, this resulted in
the first linux drive becoming f:. All because the system though I had two
hard disks and one floppy image due to the parsing twice of the configs.

	Anyway attached is a fix so that it parses the local .dosrc first...
If it doesn't find one it takes the /etc/dosemu.conf.

	Secondly, I've implemented an /etc/dosemu.users file, similar to
minicom's way of working. This allows only selected users to execute dosemu.
Create the /etc/dosemu.users file with, on each line, the name of the user
allowed to execute DOSEMU.
	This approach could be later expanded to specifying devices in the
dosemu.users file, so that only selected users are able to open specific
devices.
	Thirdly, I had to fix up the Makefile a little for ease of use.
Notice I've defined an X11LIBDIR now too.

Cheers.

Alan.

-	Also:

James,
	For some reason the gfx_cursor for the mouse was commented out.
I checked the docs and someone commented it out because it was crashing the X
stuff. Well, This fix should get rid of that. As it only call mouse_do_cur()
if we are not running X. Before it was trying to mmap even when X was running.
Bad idea .....

Tue Sep 06 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added sig subdir with Silly Interrupt Generator in toe. Did
	some preliminary testing with SIG to get it working with
	1.1.x kernels.

Mon Sep 05 1994 Jmaclean

-	From Rain:

I guess I let this stuff rust on my harddisk long enough, so here's 
another patch ;)

It includes:

- support for 28/43/50 line modes
- make xdos exit properly when it fails to open the X server
  (!includes a change to the printer code!)
- a color (xpm) icon :-)
- auto-detection of readonly floppies, which newer kernels require.

It also includes my attempts to make bios scrolls scroll the X window
directly, in the hope that it would make things faster. 
However, I found that it's at least as often slower as it's faster...

I disabled the code and left it in just because Mark might be interested
to use it for the terminal modes.

bye,
Rainer

-	From Martin Ludwig :

Hello James!

Here is my diff of dosemu pre53_12 to use a second (HGA) monitor for
dosemu while using X. I hope it will patch against pre53_15, too.

Changes against pre53_12:
* new switches -Y and -Z: giving the names of the keyboard and mouse pipe
* keyboard input from pipe instead of STDIN
* mouse input from pipe instead of asking a mouse port
* doesn't  install video-bios, uses int10.h instead
* watches port I/O of HGA-card and remapps video-memory if the second
  page is used
* uses an own cursor position routine (the one in dosemu 0.52 was removed...)
* new X-prog (xdos) which sends mouse and keyboard events from X
  to dosemu, emulating a raw keyboard

Bugs:
* no semaphore for the HGA-memory
* no mouse in graphics mode
* no test if HGA-card is there
* it leaves rxvt or xterm disturbed if started from there
* problems with msherc-programs and the second page
* large xdos-window
* some others, I think

Future plans:
* remove the bugs
* data exchange with X-progs
* perhaps an CGA or EGA emulator for HGA


Copyright:
* the same conditions as for dosemu

I hope that's all, here is the diff

Martin.Ludwig@ruba.rz.ruhr-uni-bochum.de

Tue Aug 30 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added dosconfig script by Jan Vandenberghe. Requires DIALOG. I like
	it :-).
-	Included patches from Heiko for X and timer.
-	Fixed emubat config thanks to Scottb.
-	Modified io_select() calls to start dividing into 2 camps, 
	those that use sigio and those that don't.
-	Added SIGIO ability to internal mouse driver.

Fri Aug 26 1994 Jmaclean

-	Fix that HJ already sent in and I missed :-( for the 
	-T arguement of ld from flebbe@tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de.

Wed Aug 24 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added Enhancements to CDROM driver by Karsten Rucker.
-	Added Lutz's STI patches and kernel patch sti.pat in .kernel

Fri Aug 19 1994 Jmaclean

-	Changed OpenKeyboard to keyboard_init and closeKeyboard
	to keyboard_close. Moved these out of video init procs and
	into there own separate calls. This was causing problems
	in video_config_init() as it would map in video bios
	illegally :-(.
-	Added Conditional for SIG in sigalrm to help io_select()

Wed Aug 17 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added scan to charcode returned in Xkeyb.c by put_key()
-	Tried to get lexer.l back up :-(

Tue Aug 16 1994 Jmaclean

-	Messed around with Rain's patches until all modes started
	to work. Mostly order of routines during initialization
	that had minor problems. Now for example, telnet works
	again.

Sun Aug 14 1994 Jmaclean

-	Removed SOME __inline__'s from mfs.c, still memory pig :-(.
-	Rain's latest patches.
-	Minor fixups to various files.
-	New Makefile from Mark.

Sat Aug 12 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added Rain's massive cleanups and X mouse support. This is
	NOT tested and will need some time to smoothen out.
- 	Added keymaps fixes for sg-latin1 from :
	pingu@satu.baboon.ch (Ruedi Kneubuehler).

Fri Aug 12 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added Scottb's patches to bios_emm.c and lexer.l
-	Added lsm to ./doc subdir

Thr Aug 11 1994 Jmaclean

-	Fixed keyboard latin1 statement and latin1 codes for better
	emualtion thanks to vilva@xiron.pc.helsinki.fi (Veijo Vilva).

Wed Aug 10 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added back some termio ioctl's to set ISTRIP,IGNBRK,OPOST
	and such. Seems to remove backspace in non-rawkeyboard
	mode.
- 	Added -lfl to toplevel makefile for fixing new parser not
	resolving required libs.
-	Added check to NOT add release key for ascii's with high 
	byte 0x00.

Mon Aug 08 1994 Jmaclean

-	Thanks to Rob for pointing out the NCURSES raw() command
	interference by way of his messages, the ICRNL thing should
	be dispersed, and replaced with possible new bugs :-).
-	CD-ROM extensions for DOSEMU with thanks to Karsten
	Rucker (rucker@astro.uni-bonn.de).
- 	Parser additions from Scottb. We are back to the NEW
	parser. Developer/Tester beware :-).
- 	DOSEMU-HOWTO updates from Mike.

Fri Aug 05 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added kludge to keyboard so that keypresses in non-console
	keyboard mode send keypress then keyrelease sequences. This
	seems to fix atleast WordPerfect double chars. Doesn't
	seem to help German aumlets though :-(.
-	Scottb's latest parser patches adding back emu(sys/bat) and
	a debug { X on } option.

Thu Aug 04 1994 Lutz

- dpmi/call.S is now totally rewritten to fix a problem with
  returning to DOS code (stack problem).
- CallToInit() deleted
- more dpmi cleaning/preparing

Wed Aug 03 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added patches from Tomi, Scottb to new parse generator...
	but put back in old parse generator fot this release. Well
	step back to this one hopefully in the next release.
-	Added Rain's Xdos patches. Folks, we're well on our way :-).
	Please read README.X and thank Rain for getting everything on
	it's way.

Mon Aug 01 1994 Jmaclean

-	Added new parser combo lexer.l/parser.y from Scott for all
	to play with. A bit rough but Scott would enjoy feedback :-).
- 	Fix for bug in cursor positioning that causes garbage sometimes
  	This can be a MAJOR improvement to some people because it's appliation-
  	specific.
- 	Invisible cursor support in console mode.  More visually pleasing.
- 	Cursor in ANSI and NCURSES is now put at position 0,0 whenever the
  	cursor is invisible or off-screen.
- 	Improvements to character blinking disable/enable code (this stops the
  	annoying blinking when you run PCTools over a telnet line)

-	Note from Markkk about new ansi_xterm :

"ANSI Xterm 2.0 is a specially modified Xterm that is compatible with DOSEMU
and to enable the use of all 16 colors, and the entire PC character set.
This makes DOSEMU just like xdos in this area!

Furthermore, just follow the instructions included with ANSI Xterm 2.0
for an easy compile.  Then all you need to do is type "xdosemu" to bring
up an Xwindow running DOSEMU.   The xdosemu command automatically detects
for the existence of ansi_xterm.  If it does not exist, it detects for
a regular xterm and rxvt next.

Try it, and let Mark Rejhon know at mdrejhon@csclub.uwaterloo.ca
as he is responsible for this."

Mon Aug 01 1994 Jmaclean

-	Markks latest and greatest additions to the Xterm capabilities
	of DOSEMU. Best to get ansi_xterm from a site at this time :-).
-	Detach capability added, thanks to Karl Hakimian. Now with 
	the optional -d parm, a new VT will be switched to for starting
	and running DOSEMU.
-	Added __map_page() to fix EMS error caused by remap() calling
	__unamp_page() first. FoxPro is running again.

Fri Jul 29 1994 Jmaclean

-	By Jon's request, set '_''s to '-' in keyboard parms
	in examples/config.dist
-	By Jon's request, added 'make most' option which does
	NOT make the doc subdir.

Tue Jul 26 1994 Jmaclean

-	Thanks to Scottb which fixed the DOSEMU memory problems
	with pointing out that mmap annonymous needed PRIVATE and
	not SHARED to work :-) We're back on the road again .

Sat Jul 23 1994 Rain

 * Largely reworked {re}{un}map_page, removed v_mmap.
   COPY/MMAP/IPC_EMS conditionals are now in map_page and friends.
   Fixed MMAP_EMS: mmap() mapped the wrong way around  (-:
   Still doesn't work, mmap() patch is broken :-(
 * EMS_IPC is completely screwed up and probably not easy to make work.
   The problem is that one cannot do partial mappings of shared
   memory regions. Left it in, though.
 * added COPY_EMS conditional (for the standard 'mapping' method)
 * added UNMAP_BEFORE_MAP conditional to leave out unmapping
   of old mappings in map_page for MMAP_EMS.
   Shouldn't be necessary because the kernel'll do this for us.
 * made some calls to re{un}map_page dependent on COPY_EMS
   because they are only there to update the logical memory
 * restore_handle_state: unmap pages which were previously unmapped
 * reallocate_pages:
   reunmap only pages belonging to the current handle.
   Fixed a bug: pages above newcount were left mapped.
 * some minor optimizations, fixes and cleanups...

Thr Jul 21 1994 JES

	- Patches from Rainer Zimmermann (zimmerm@Mathematik.UNi-Marburg.DE)
	  for time-problems with mfs.c
	- Added procedure to make dosemu.map which is usefull for 
	  finding where DOSEMU bombs, like kernel. Thanks Daniel :-)

Sat Jul 14 1994 JES

	- Latest enhancements from Markkk.

Sat Jul 11 1994 JES

	- Latest termio.c with keyboard enhancements from Markkk
	- Added SIGIO conditional on uname().

Sun Jul 10 09:38:23 1994  Jochen Hein  (jochen@No-MS-DOS)

	* added setlocale-call to dos.c
	* reformatted highscan[] in termio.c

Sat Jul 09 1994 JES

	- DPMI patches from Lutz
	- Pktdriver enhancements by Rob
	- Mouse patch from Douglas Gleichman p86884@tcville.ES.hac.com
	- Changed install dos as per Jochen
	- Windows 3.0 mouse is back.
	- I added insert esc-seq to gettermcap of termio.c 

Tue Jul 05 1994 JES

	- Finally... Markkk succeeds where so many of us have failed.
	  NCURSES support is here, and I believe to stay :-). It's 
	  still a bit rough, but it IS. You should truly think about
	  getting ncurses-1.8.5.tgz from:
	  netcom.com:pub/zmbenhal/ncurses/1.8.5.tgz
	  This of course brings color to serial lines and preps for
	  many more. I couldn't activate it on a telnet or rlogin 
	  connect yet. Thanks Markkk, from many of us :-).

Sat Jul 02 1994 JES

	- Finally... interrupt routines are called by functions of
	  an array. I'm certain that someone can come up with a better
	  method as I'm using 0x100 pointers in interrupt_function().

Tue Jun 28 1994 JES

	- Markkk brings actuall character set to DOSEMU
	  when in non-graphics mode ... Yaaa :-). Pease
	  read README.ibmset
	- Patch to modify timers done in SIGALRM.

Fri Jun 24 1994 JES

	- Markks console cursor patches, and more speed increses to
	  serial stuff.
	- Small change to mfs.c to correct wrong return codes for
	  findfirst. Seems t speed up directory searches, but may
	  just be my imagination :-).
	- Messed around with SIGILL a bit to try and track down reported
	  problem starting DOSEMU for some that causes SIGILL with 
	  instr of 2e:f7 (cs:div?). No solution yet.
	- Hacked ./init/parse.c a bit to exchange_uids when running
	  overide config files. Now /etc/dosemu.conf always runs, then
 	  overrides can be speced in optional config files.
	  Doesn't work yet :-(

Tue Jun 14 1994 JES

	- Next set of patches from Markkk. Major overhaul started
	  that is really improving termcap. Way to go Markkk!
	- Alistair has completed in no time flat his automoted 
	  DANG application. At this time I have NOT included his
	  perl script, but hope to soon. Look in ../doc/DANG[.sgml].
	- Michael provides us with an updated DOSEMU-HOWTO in 
	  .txt,.ps, and .sgml format.
	- Alan has another few patches bringing mice support along
	  even further.
	- Tim's IPX patches for 1.1.14 kernels +.

Mon Jun 13 1994 JES

	- First set of termcap patches from Markkk

-	Latest additions from Alan for busmice.
-	UMB fixes by Scott.

Sun Jun 05 1994 JES

-	Alan's latest patches for busmice with a start for graphics
	support.
-	Alessandro Rubini (rubini@ipvvis.UNIPV.IT) patches to make 
	Makefiles inherit important common include directory paths.
-	By suggestion from Jon Tombs, make default inb return 0xff
	and the creation of tempdir be strdup'ed incase it's freed
	by a config request.
-	Changed CNTR timers to count UP by 0x2221 instead of down.
-	Changed a compare in xms.c according to Scott Buchholz.

Thu Jun 02 1994 JES

-	Patches from Rob including updates to s3 code.
-	Daniels idea about malloc problem worked into emu.c by
	moving where scrbuf is allocated. Wonder why it was allocated
	where it was.

Sun May 29 1994 JES

-	Stuck in a fix for DIR a: error. It's a KLUDGE  for now, but
	I hope it will show where the error is.

Thr May 26 1994 JES

-	More mods to int_queue_run(). Changed where set_leds() is 
	called.
-	Moved int.h and int10.h to emu.c as that is where do_int()
	is called mostly now.
-	Scott's latest patches against 1.0.x & 1.1.x
-	Rob's patches to remove linpkt from DOSEMU tree.

Sat May 21 1994 JES

-	Lutz's latest patches cleaning up DPMI, etc...

Thr May 19 1994 JES

-	Added Jochen's patches to Makefile.

Wed May 18 1994 JES

-	Added EMS patch from Scott
-	Added diffs from Jochen.
-	Started work on keyboard simplifying. Made lastscan into
	*LASTSCAN a bios area variable.

Mon May 17 1994 Jochen

-	Changed int 8&9 to use a memory location in bios for outb(0x20).
	This nolonger needs to back off to DOSEMU from an outb20. This
	caused vm86() not to return enough to run it's int8's, so 
	sigalrm has been modified to be called more often. At the same
	time I now have the pit controllers decremented. Not sure if
	this will be of any use or not. For fun just change the 
	TIMER_DIVISOR define at the top of emu.c
	(Hopefully I'll do this for int9 scancodes next)

-	Fixed bug in EMS coded Sunday that stopped Windows 3.0 from
	properly launching programs.

-	Makefile fixed to distribute ./ipxutils. Thanks Jochen.

-	To EMS added Alternate Map Register Set, OS/E Function Set.
	Windows 3.0 now boots without EMS error(All necessary FNX's
	are supported). Some other cleanup's to EMS including Handle
	Naming.

Thr 13 May 1994 JES

-	Totally changed int_queue_run(). Now only int's requiring
	callback will be forced to.

Wed 11 May 1994 JES

-	Markkk's latest serial.
-	Made ipxutils subdir optionally compile

Tue 10 May 1994 JES

-	Made int08 inline, still need 0x1c to be inline too.
-	Added back outb20 check to fix stacking of interrupts
	which included int08 stacking.
-	Floppy drive sticking has mysteriously vanished.

Mon 9 May 1994 JES

-	IPX updates by Tim Bird. Please look in ./ipxutils for more
	info.
-	Addition of -n pktdrvr option by Rob. Look in 
	./examples/config.dist.
	
Sat 7 May 1994 Jochen

	* [disk.c disk.h]
	creating the name for the partition-decsription-file moved to
	parse.c, because we need to check the existance of this file there.
	without this file is running further useless. dosemu may hang
	silently.

	* [emu.c]
	use config.exitearly instead of exitearly and stop dosemu earlier
	when set.

	* [parse.c config.dist include/mouse.h mouse/*]
	attempt to use cleardtr for some mousesystem/microsoft compatible
	mice. mostly unsuccesful.

	* [init/Makefile init/parse.c]
	more compiler warnings removed. Error-checking implemented.

	1 ../net.o object for linking.

April 27, 1994  JES

-	If your kernel is of the 1.0.x nature, patch with 
	kernel.1.0.x.diff. If your kernel is 1.1.x where x is less
	than 9, patch with kernel.1.1.9.diff. If your kernel is
	1.1.9 patch with kernel.post.1.1.9.diff. Have fun :-)

	deskview giveup timeslices.

April 19, 1994  JES

-	Rob's pktdrvr enhancements. Ready for testing.
	rnzll3!pe1chl!rob@relay.NL.net. Should be possible 
	to run different stacks on this one. Doesnot require 
	loading linpkt.

	to danpop@cernapo.cern.ch (Dan Pop)
-	Broke sigsegv() out of cpu.c into just sigsegv.c as to compile
	do_int(), inb/outb(), et al inline now needs a 6meg swap on
	my 4 meg system at work :-(

March 23, 1994	macleajb@ednet.ns.ca

-	Added #def's for E000 video bios testing.
-	Added more DPMI from Lutz.

-	Lutz Molgedey has been making great advances in DPMI and
	although not ready for household use, is included.
	molgedey@theo-physik.uni-kiel.de.

February 20, 1994	macleajb@ednet.ns.ca

-	Wordperfect HOME key stopped working :-( why ?????

February 17, 1994	macleajb@ednet.ns.ca

	WordPerfect HOME key problem, and nothing else :-(.

February 1, 1994	macleajb@ednet.ns.ca

-	First layer of terminfo patches in from Corey 
	(corey@amiganet.chi.il.us)

-	Mouse now closes/opens on VC switches. I can now use X and a
	mouse in DOSEMU. Serial is still buggy though.

-	gorden@jegnixa.hsc.missouri.edu only came on stream less than
	a month ago and has already added a pktdriver interface. Could
	we have another Robert S. here?

-	dos_helper() int 0xe5 changed to 0xe6 to allow my FCB program
	Direct Access to work.

-	FCB callouts added to redirector. Lahey Fortran now works,
	as dos Direct Access.

-	Tim_R_Bird@Novell.COM IPX has been added to dosemu. What's
	Tim's next surprise?

-	Tim fixed LREDIR.EXE so that emufs.sys no longer has to
	be loaded once at boot.

-	Tim fixed an error in SIGSTACK.

-	Int15 0xc0 callout has been modified to deal with DOS programs
	wishing to override scan codes going into the KBD buffer. Still
	needs work.

-	Allow USAGE to display before default stderr redirection.

-	Made dos auto-redirect to stderr if no redirection given on
	command line.

-	Added simple saytime() function to display message and CLOCK
	time.

-	Modified hard_int routine many times to try and make int 9, as
	well as other ints stay serial and yet nt have to wait for
	program to return to return_address.

-	Added Corey@amiganet.chi.il.us patches to exchange 
	stderr <-> stdout. This is to prepare for terminfo.

-	Indented all source code according to INDENT.PRO.

-	Deleted int16 function.

-	Added dpmi/dpmi.h include for interrupts.

-	Added code to allow int09 (keyboard) to allow another interrupt by using
 	outb(20) called by dos programs.
 
-	Modified inline int09 to pass ALL keys to int15-4f function.

-	Added a far return for DPMI call to go protected.

-	Removed old int16 function.

-	Changed int08 inside of do_int() to return after being called.

-	EMS is very close to full 4.0 specs. I've taken the need for
	patching the kernel out at this time so that more folks will
	test EMS. Unfortunately it is horribly slow. Many thanks to
	mikebat@netcom.com (Mike Batchelor).

-	(Theadore Ts'o's)tytso@ATHENA.MIT.EDU created the booton bootoff
	patch. Now a user can boot from a bootdisk a:, type diskimage, 
	and then return control of a: to /dev/fd0. Alright :-).

-	Added routine to allow Diamond Card to go graphics.

-	Much effort has been put into keyboard enhancements, 
	which have not been that fruitful. Need to have numlock off
	to cut & paste within MSDOS edit, and WordPerfect 5.1 's home
	key does not work as expected.

-	Keyboard kinda does a REAL int9.

-	Fixed UMB size 0, and move XMS edx:ebx problem.

-	Added more SS overflow checks.

-	Added call in SIGILL to check if illegal op-code is just another
	hard interrupt ending. It calls int_queue_run() and sees if such
	was the case.

-	Added WORD macro in push/pop functions.

-	Added check for DPMI far call.

-	Small ET4000 updates from info from Robert Saunders. Thanks.
	Needs more testing.

-	Redirector now truncates files properly (with fingers crossed)
	Calls to create_truncate existant files is closer to correctly
	being handled.

-	Modified findfirst/findnext routine.

-	Added 0x80 flag to tell DOS it's not lanman redirector.

-	Poor excuse for an update to work with ../NUL device. Also 
	added code to allow mfs.c properly deal the GetRedirection 
	with Novell-Lite Printers.

-	Added lredir using environment vars by 
	coosman@asterix.uni-muenster.de

Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 1993  jmaclean

-	Problem with multiple instances of emufs.sys has been destroyed
	I believe.

-	tytso@ATHENA.MIT.EDU (Theodore Ts'o) has added the ability
	to boot off a bootimage file as drive a:, then release drive
	a: back to dosemu as the actual /dev/fd0 via booton/bootoff
	in autoexec.bat. See ./examples/config.dist for parameters.

-	As usual the keyboard routines have been dug up more.
	Still MSDOS edit.com needs numlock off to cut&paste. ARG!
	Someone could really make my day if they pointed out what
	I'm doing wrong.

-	Added video option chipset for diamond for some diamond
	cards, specifically Diamond Speedstar 24x with a 
	Paradise/Western Digital chipset. Many thanks to
	patrickm@gas.uug.arizona for putting up with me.
	This does no more than allow 'graphics' for
	this card type.

-	Overhauled EMS to allow it to work with programs that I
	use. It nolonger requires the mmap.diff patch, so please
	don't use it. I'm just carrying it along because the way Robert
	did EMS mapping was better, and I hope to move back to that
	after folks start beating this version around a bit.

-	Debugged XMS a bit more to work with UMB's and passing the
	correct XMS address for XMS moves.

-	Some more messing with ET4000, thanks to Robert alias 
	Nils Rennebarth for the ET4000 stuff. Unfortunately I am
	in need of another tester to start relaying bugs. Any takers?

-	Diffed in patch[1-3]_against_pl3.dif applied:
	-	First patch fixed a timer problem mainly.
	-	Second patch limited VC switching to left alt key.
	-	Third patch almost finishes my changes in keyboard
		routines.

-	coosman@asterix.uni-muenster.de submitted patches to mfs.c
          which allow lredir to access environment variables like are
          now used in emufs.sys.

-	coosman@asterix.uni-muenster.de fixed the 15 character limit
 	  on keybaords, some keyboard extenders should now work, 
	  yes :-).

-	coosman@asterix.uni-muenster.de also submitted dumpconf.asm
          to try and fix the multiple emufs.sys instance problem.
	  Still unsuccessful, any takers?

-	Changed dosvga.h to video.h

-	tytso@ATHENA.MIT.EDU (Theodore Ts'o) aided in getting mfs.c
	to do the ftruncate thing more like DOS. Still not sure if
	it's up to the full 100%.

Mon Nov 29 00:00:00 1993  jmaclean

* Another update of multiple bugfixes :-).

	- Keyboard internals have been really rearranged. I'm not sure I'm
	  keeping them this way, but now cut&paste problems should hopefully
	  go away. Also any program that looked at the bios memory for 
	  checking ctrl-alt-shift statuses have a better chance of operating.
          Still seems to be some lagging (somewhere).

	- German keyboard patches thanks to hein@tlaloc.in.tu-clausthal.de
	  (Jochen Hein) which should fix that multiple alt key problem a 
	  couple people have asked about, as well as some incorrect mappings.

	- As always mfs.c has been updated again to react to another funny
	  one on DOS's part. If a file was open write, and actually written to,
	  it should be O_TRUNC first. If its just opened for writing, and not 
	  actually written to, the file should exist as was when closed. ARG!
	  The fix is a kludge, and needs some work!

	- Ross Biro <bir7@leland.Stanford.EDU> gives us some more fixes for
	  the redirector, and includes a new toy/option for emufs.sys. Now
	  in you config.sys you can add a device statement like:
		- device=c:\emufs.sys \${HOME}/dosstuff
	  which will allow you to use your home directory as part of the
	  path. Any environment variable can be used.

	- alan@spri.levels.unisa.edu.au (Alan Modra) fixed some flag setting
	  problems in the emulated int13 code.

	- bde@kralizec.zeta.org.au (Bruce Evans) noticed some initilization
	  problems as did -

	- alan@spri.levels.unisa.edu.au (Alan Modra), so we have changes to 
	  the registers at boot time, good for some disks that need everything
	  just right :-).

	- And not to forget fin!chip@dg-rtp.dg.com (Chip Salzenberg) who got
	  rid of those annoying errors when bison was running.

	- Makefile has been altered hopefully to cleanup those 'separator
	  missing messages'.

	- parse/parse.c will not be contained in the distribution and should
	  limit that parse.tab.h not found error.

* From announce0.49pl2

	- This release has some important changes, actually bug fixes, and some
	new functionality to emufs.sys. (The hardrive redirector) It allows
	us to redirect the redirected drives using a DOS program LREDIR after
	booting, thanks to Tim Bird (Tim_R_Bird@Novell.COM) .
	 
	- Video switching is still growing, and has had some fixes for Trident
	cards, as well as changing routines for saving and restoring video
	memory above the first bank. ET4000 code is still giving some problems
	so be aware. 

	- Keyboard control has been enhanced using a real time int16 interrupt.
	Thanks Tim. This is important for WordPerfect users, Dosshell,
	Qbasic, and many other problems that have been attributed to keyboard
	problems. This has not been proved to fix the 1 key behind problem
	yet.:-(

	- Sdh@po.cwru.edu (Scott D. Heavner) has allowed us to specify an
	alternate config file using dos -F'filename' etc with his patches.

	- A problem writing files in WordPerfect on emufs.sys drives has been
	irraticated. 

	- Dir listings that included the volume label attribute were only 
	returning the volume label, and no dir listing. Fixed. Thanks to
	karel@obelix.icce.rug.nl.

	- Finally the keyboard problem has had another important fix thanks to
	ronnie@lysator.liu.se (ronnie s.) via Robert (gt8134b@prism.gatech.edu)
	that should fix the keyboard behind by 1 problem.

Tue Jul 13 19:54:13 1993  rsanders

	* Makefile: cleanups...

Tue Jul 13 19:24:54 1993  root

	* cpu.c, cpu.h, emu.c:
	changes for using the new (0.99pl10) signal stacks

Wed Jul  7 21:44:51 1993  root

	* emu.c: hook for parse_config(name);

	* parse.c:
	added support for ~/.dosrc and parse_config() now takes a filename
	argument to override .dosrc check.

Mon Jun  7 20:26:09 1993    (root@hrothgar)

	* emu.c (char_out): more BIOS-like handling of int
	0x29...character attributes are now reserved, and scrollup now
	uses the attribute from the previous char (needs more work).

Fri Jun  4 01:43:39 1993    (root@hrothgar)

	* cpu.c (find_port): added Andrew's patches diff1-6, which include
	the maskable port I/O.  Began fixes to allow ports beyond 0x3ff.

Thu Jun  3 23:05:26 1993    (root@hrothgar)

	* emu.c (ms_dos): fixed up the EmuSys and EmuBat directives.  They
	now take string arguments.

Thu May 27 21:38:08 1993    (root@hrothgar)

	* bios_emm.c (bios_emm_init): moved into dosipc.c: memory_setup().
	Now checks that /proc/self/mem is mmap()able, and turns off EMS
	support if it isn't.

Wed May 26 01:09:23 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* moved 0xE000 segment routines to 0xF000.  also changed reboot
	code to use inte5, ax=0xffff

Tue May 25 01:41:53 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added early support for the EmuSys and EmuBat directives, which
	remap CONFIG.SYS to CONFIG.EMU and AUTOEXEC.BAT to AUTOEXEC.EMU.
	This works now, but I'm not sure when I should disable it.

Mon May 24 21:50:33 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added CMOS checksum.

	* dosemu 0.49 released!

Fri May 14 00:41:08 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* cleaned up the int10h ah=9/0xA calls...they now work correctly
	except for possible bounds checking.

	* made floppies safe, but slow...work on this.

Wed May  5 02:18:23 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added mouse support and console switching even in graphics
	mode.

Tue Apr 20 00:49:07 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added DMSG_PAUSE for pausing the parent...

	* fixed a lot of int10() problems, including cursor positioning
	and int10h 0xa/0x9.

Fri Apr 16 08:58:43 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added VGA BIOS support...user vgaon.com to allow it, vgaoff.com
	to stop it. 

Wed Apr 14 03:44:36 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* now have mfs.c updated all the way to diff9, which has multiple
	drive support...(not my doing!).  also translated linux.asm into
	emufs.S. 

Mon Apr 12 22:08:39 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added the 1-second tick in dosipc.c.  the child gets a SIGALRM
	every second, which child_tick() handles.  currently only calls
	print_tick(). 

Tue Apr  6 00:20:05 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* stold the Mach DOS emulator's UMB routines. PCShell no longer
	crashes, PKZIP now uses it.  PKZIP 2.04e won't use EMS :-( and
	neither will debug.

	* ported bios_emm.c (EMS emulation) from the Mach DOS emulator. It
	relies on my kernel hack of mmap(/dev/selfmem). Works pretty well,
	emulates EMS version 3.2.

	* applied diff1,diff2,and diff3 from Andrew Tridgell. MFS works
	better, faster.  MFS also adjusts for being run suid root.  The
	default interrupt (0xfe) conflicts with Turbo Debugger.  I suggest
	a change to 0xe5.

Thu Apr  1 03:08:22 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* translated the bootsect.S code for as86.  This is nice for
	general interest, and for the distribution hdimage (which requires
	fdisk /mbr to fix it, by the way).

Wed Mar 31 01:00:37 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* integrated Andrew Tridgell's port of the Mach mfs redirector.
	Seems to work okay, if not blazingly fast.  Sure beats linux.exe.

	* changed VIRT_SCREEN_BASE and INIT_VIDEO_MODE for MDA to actually
	show MDA mode 7 and base of 0xb0000.

	* added PARTITION type.  only works with /dev/hd?1. relies upon
	the file "/etc/dosemu/partition" to be the first sector (Master
	Boot Record) of /dev/hd?.  

Tue Mar 30 02:51:33 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* changed disks.c a lot, added the IMAGE file header code (to
	auto-detect geometry from an image file).

Mon Mar 29 00:47:41 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added the int 0x2f, ax=0x1680 "give up time slice" function.
	does a usleep()...is this best?  thanks to Andrew Tridgell.

	* changed disks.c to simply accept FLOPPY_A as defined

	* changed -f option to take an argument

Sun Mar 28 02:07:50 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* wrote dosconfig.c to replace dosconfig.sh.  

	* changed the int16h ah=0x55 to return eax=0 for MS-WORD 5 (check
	this with Andrew Tridgell). 

	* fixed up some of the CONFIGURATION (int 11h value) stuff.  see
	emu.c, config_init()

Mon Mar  8 00:37:07 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added dosconfig.sh for "make config", rearranged Makefile to be
	a little safer.  It tries to keep the user's config.h updated, but
	not to recompile too often.  (dosconfig.sh uses awk)

	* cleaned up get_video_ram()...Turbo debugger 3.0 now works, at
	least the video stuff does.

	* added some fixes so that leavedos() will timeout after 3
	seconds or so, but I still need to find out why/where it hangs.

	* added memory.h and video.c.  added "make dep" to Makefile.

Sun Mar  7 15:05:10 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added an ugly hack for multiple screen pages...nasty. works okay
	for Turbo Debugger 1.0, though.  also began marking hacks with
	XXX...most everything new&old is a hack, sadly enough.  termio.c &
	emu.c need to be robbed of the screen functions, which will be put
	in screen.c. also the emu.h and termio.h headers...clean the
	get_video_ram & put_video_ram stuff...

Thu Mar  4 01:23:04 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added the proper set-iflag-after-instruction STI emulation.  it
	doesn't seem worth it, so I disabled it be default (define
	PROPER_STI in cpu.c or the Makefile to get it working).

	* got the HMA working perfectly.  moved the IPC_RMIDs into
	memory_shutdown(), called by stop_dosipc, so that the HMA area,
	which isn't always attached, wouldn't go away unexpectedly.

	* used krishna's new ipcdelta stuff (the SHM_REMAP flag) to make
	the low page shared, too. I should break this out of the main
	segment1. verified that it works.

	* added SIGCHLD handler, fixed up the DMSG_ACK situation. still
	need to design a rational, interrupt-like protocol for this.

	* added shared memory to dosemu. I haven't gotten Krishna's new
	stuff yet, so I don't share the first page (I NEED TO!). 2 segments,
	one from 0x1000-0x9ffff, the other 0xc0000-0xfffff.  Because of
	stupid mmap(), I can't share the segment from 0xa0000-0xbffff, as
	mmap() needs memory under, and IPC can't have memory under.

Tue Mar  2 02:07:57 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* apparently, whatever badness in DOS 5.0 that caused the SIGSEGV
	when booting has gone away, or I've fixed it, so I took the
	boot_in_progress checks out (partially, I'm a little wary).  We'll
	see how it goes.

	* made the child process munmap() everything from page 2 (address
	4096) to the page before LIBSTART.  this should cut down on memory
	usage a little, as well as make attaching shm a little easier.
	still doesn't fix first page problem, but Krishna is doing that.

	* changed the format of the DOS HELPER function to show interrupts
	(now takes low int in BH,high int in BL).  Also added a parameter
	to show_ints(). also added -2 option for 80286 flags emulation.
	(real-mode 80286 keeps upper 4 flag bits (15,14,13,12) clear.

	* added two new switches, -3 and -4, that allow you to choose 386
	or 486 "emulation"...this currently only changes the behavior of
	the AC (alignment check) bit of EFLAGS, but since that IS the
	Intel-recommended test...I need to add emulation for BSWAP, XADD,
	and CMPXCHG instructions for 386 users running in 486 mode (just for
	kicks :-). I wonder if PKZIP 2.04 is much faster in 386/486 mode...

Mon Mar  1 01:35:53 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added code to keep virtual IOPL, NT, bit15 of eflags register.
	this means I also have to interpret the 0x66 and 0x67 instruction
	prefixes (32-bit operand and address, respectively).  this must be
	done in sigsegv()...it's just ignored now

	* split dosemu into 2 processes, one of which currently only
	monitors keypresses.  I use UNIX domain sockets--pipe() returns a
	uni-directional pipe :-(

	* tried to speed up clear_screen() for non-console video.

Thu Feb 25 21:19:10 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* fixed show_regs() to display an iflag-adjusted eflags.  I should
	make access functions to _regs.eflags so that "virtualized" bits
	are always handled correctly.

	* fixed iflag/IF handling...Matthias had forgotten to adjust iflag
	on popf and iret. Silly boy.  I wasn't doing much better, testing
	IF directly from the _regs.eflags after return from vm86(), which
	of course corresponded to the system IF...someone should write a
	virtual-8086 mode tutorial!

Wed Feb 24 11:33:59 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* fixed the key-repeat bug.

Tue Feb 23 01:36:17 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* well, the ugliness with indirect far calling can be
	skipped...however, I can only get pcshell to work with the mouse,
	and it doesn't use callbacks!  added lctrl+rctrl+capslock = toggle
	kayboard mouse...arrow keys are direction, home is left and end
	is right button.

	* made the first brain-dead changes for mouse support.

Mon Feb 22 16:26:17 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* cleaned up the show_regs() a bit, better display of flags, shows
	10 bytes before and after CS:EIP.

	* added the define FAST_BUT_WRONG29, which, if defined, makes
	int29 fast char output faster, but makes programs that hook int29
	fail.  ANSI.SYS is one of these.  I leave FAST_... defined, as
	ANSI.SYS doesn't work now anyway.

	* added the extended (32-bit) XMS 3.0 API.  cleaned up xms.c to be
	a little more 32-bit clean (i.e. doesn't fudge upper 16 bits of
	register if it's not supposed to).  Added the macros LWORD() and
	HWORD() to emu.h...

Sat Feb 20 17:43:50 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added Bill Bogstad's (bogstad@cs.jhu.edu)
	auto-hd-geometry-detect code.  It seems to work okay.

Thu Feb 18 01:38:21 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* RELEASE: released these changes as 0.48.patch1.  Peter Macdonald
	(pmacdona@sanjuan.uvic.ca) says he'll incorporate this into his SLS.

	* changes NUM_HANDLES for XMS to 64. took out handle_mask.

	* added the screen-buffer-and-compare code to restore_screen().
	this ought to really speed up the non-console users

Wed Feb 17 15:40:54 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* fixed up the Makefile to make libemu start at 1 GB... this is
	really really important, as the dosemu0.48 distribution's MAX_XMS
	of 3072 could overrun into libemu...I don't know why it works this
	way, but it does (actually, I do know why, I just don't know why
	sbrk() lets you move into a shared lib).  Anyway, now xms.c checks
	that you have space left for MAX_XMS (at compile time, will have
	to be dynamic-ized to run time XMS size setting)

	* removed the check for console_keyb before calling
	PollKeyboard...non-console users deserve a keyboard, too!

Tue Feb 16 00:29:58 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* cmos RTC now returns values in BCD if appropriate (usually is)

	* fixed the keypad number keys.  forgot to put scancode in upper
	byte. also fixed the F11 and F12 keys.

	* added man page, and the rest is history.
	  DOSEMU 0.48 DISTRIBUTION

Mon Feb 15 00:24:50 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* added all the ctrl and alt cursor keys.

	* added the files cmos.c and cmos.h.  these will eventually
	contain all the CMOS values needed and provide CMOS real-time
	clock and alarm support.  current code covers time/date, disk
	setup, memory size, CMOS status.

Sun Feb 14 16:50:28 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* put the special_nowait call into read Extended keycode also.
	I've really gotta verify this.

Sat Feb 13 15:26:20 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* uh, fixed the XMS EMB alloc. problem.  I swear I checked for
	this when I first had problems, but apparently not...I was
	malloc()ing the actual K size, instead of the K size * 1024.

	* added some XMS functions, made the XMSControl entry point
	conform to the spec (for hookability).

Fri Feb 12 14:19:30 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* put the 101-key keyboard flag in the BIOS

	* Added the timer_tick() routine. this fixes a LOAD of
	stuff...4DOS beep lockup, 4HELP, Norton utilities, checkit,
	autocnf, bunches and bunches of stuff, basically.  This still
	needs a LOT of work, like keeping track of round off error, higher
	frequency, but it'll do for now.

Thu Feb 11 01:53:27 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* changed ReadString to accept almost any characters.  I'm still
	not sure about the ones below space.

	* char_out now treats \n as \n\r.  I wonder about this.  also,
	ctrl-c checking is done a little more properly (look for dos_ctrlc())

	* added the hold-alt-and-type keypad numbers entry method.  still
	need to add alt/shift/ctrl-cursor keys.

Wed Feb 10 13:08:05 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* WordPerfect works perfectly now :-). almost.

	* added Rshift-scrlock for int8, lshift-scrlock for int9.  funny
	thing is, these work better than the flags.  makes me wonder about
	the whole signal handler thing, and maybe I should check the IF.

	* added the -K flag.  sorta makes QBASIC/EDIT work.  if I use the
	-t switch (timer int), then msdos will crash eventually with a GP
	fault on 0xe8.

Tue Feb  9 15:45:54 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* XMS can now allocate the HMA and a single UMB at 0xc000.  I
	really need to make sure that 0xc000 isn't BIOS-mapped, but I'm
	just playing now, anyway.  This is fun!  I can put dos=high,umb in
	my config.sys and get 702K posible executable size! (with -m 720)

	* began the XMS stuff.  Have a driver that can mark its presence
	and claim no HMA. :-) 

	* fixed the dir /w problem by allowing int 21h to do its own char
	out.  however, I found an anomaly in the get video combination
	code.  I can return 4 (color EGA), but not 8 (color VGA).  If I
	do, qedit freaks and puts the menu up off the screen as if the video
	memory started at 0xb000:0000.  The same thing happens if I change
	BL in video subsystem.

Mon Feb  8 02:05:07 1993    (root at hrothgar)

        * this (or herabouts) is RELEASE 0.47.7

	* fixed the heavy-load miss characters thing.  The keybuffer code
	Stephen Tweedie gave me would advance the buffer even if ReadKeyboard
	was called with wait=TEST.

Fri Feb  5 01:51:08 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* okay, fixed the lost characters thing for real: Matthias' int29h
	handler (fast DOS tty output) was calling int 10h/ah=e.  int 29h
	output always goes to the current screen, and Matthias wasn't
	taking that into account.

Thu Feb  4 00:35:57 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* i know why...I'm doing that damn WAITACTIVE ioctl(). damn damn
	damn! I see no way around that. (later note: it might in fact
	be the fact that I was often deleting libemu out from under
	dosemu's feet with rm -f, and now that I've stopped that,
	everything's better. Should I keep the ioctl queue?)

	* well, it seems that my ioctl queue hasn't stopped the kernel
	panics. here's what I get (raw keyboard mode):
 general protection: 0000
 EIP:    0008:00047325
 EFLAGS: 00010286
 fs: 0017
 base: 00000000, limit: C0000000
 Pid: 464, process nr: 16
 64 88 08 4e 85 ed 74 13 8b 15 
 
 wait_queue is bad (eip = 00000201)
         q = 0017b864
        *q = 00236f6c
       tmp = 00236f6c

(repeat the wait_queue block 7 times)

 Unable to handle kernel paging request at address c0000004
 Oops: 0000
 EIP:    0008:0004748B
 EFLAGS: 00010093
 fs: 0017

 Pid: 31, process nr: 8
 39 50 04 75 f8 8b 4c 24 1c 89 

	* well, pkzip 2.04e uses int10h/ah=e with a seemingly random
	screen page.  PC-DOS 4.01 seems to do the same thing. so, in my
	infinite wisdom, if it writes to a screen page > 7, i make it
	write to the current screen page.  this is probably wrong, but it
	works for pkzip 2.04e.

	* fixed the PollKeyboard() thing, I think.  I use a "queue" for
	ioctl()'s started from within an interrupt handler.  this is
	nasty, but it'll have to do.  I can make this a lot pretier.

	* AAARRRRRGH! PollKeyboard() was crashing the emulator (kernel
	panics and such) because I was using select()...and looky here,
	pg. 278 of the Stevens book, select() is NOT listed as one of the
	reentrant functions.  I'm a fool. A FOOL, I tell you!

	* these changes I will call dosemu0.47.5

	* also added choice of PHANTOMDIR and VIDEO_CARD to the Makefile.
	VIDEO_CARD only has effect if it is set to MDA: the
	PHYS_SCREEN_BASE will then be set to 0xb0000 instead of 0xb8000.

	* Now you can choose your RAW keyboard nationality in the Makefile
	(like with a kernel compile).  Gotta clean this up later with a
	keymaps subdir, and all the keymaps therein.  Also noticed that
	when 4dos freezes up during a beep, ctrl-break (in RAW mode, of
	course), fixes it :-).  Added these keys to RAW (-k) mode:
	   ctrl-alt-pgup  ... exit the emulator
	   ctrl-alt-pgdn  ... "reboot" the emulator (not recommended)
	   ctrl-break     ... as in DOS
	   ctrl-scrollock ... show first 0x30 interrupt vectors
	   alt-scrollock  ... show registers
	for some reason, keypad cursor keys (pgup/pgdn/delete) when
	combined with the ctrl-alt keys will cause nasty things to happen.
	Things like kernel panics, hard system reboots, etc.  Is this my
	fault, or Linux's? (I'm sure it's mine, but I can't figure out how)

Wed Feb  3 12:07:16 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* Added some elementary key-polling in sigalrm() with
	PollKeyboard(). This works okay for now, but I really need to make
	in general purpose (not just for console_keyb) and make the key
	buffer use the BDA for real. Then we've got keyboard about done,
	except for the multi-national keyboard maps.

	* Added Stephen Tweedie's small patches for insert-key into
	keyboard buffer (InsKeyboard).  This needs to be rewritten to use
	the real BDA queue.

	* made the parse-debugflags kinda recursive, so a and 0 don't
	terminate the parsing.  This allows for handy option strings like
	"-a+v" or "0+v" for debugging just video.  

Tue Feb  2 15:21:59 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* note that DOSKEY works now! Nathan says it didn't before.  Oh,
	well. I thought it didn't.

	* cleaned up the debug-msg flags a bit.  now the -D option
	specifies a list of options.  also cleaned up the int-revectoring
	a tad.  moved a little of the stuff into emu.h (a lot more needs
	to go)

	* added the -f option to flip A: and B: floppies.  I also have the
	-B flag to boot from the b: drive, but I don't think DOS will ever
	be happy with that.  might take it out before release.

	* NEED to find out what int 16h/ah=0x55 does.  it seems to control
	timeout for get_char (int 16h/ah=1), and is necessary for dosshell
	and qbasic (which freeze occasionally otherwise).

	* added some wacky int-revectoring code.  all but int 16h is broke
	right now, and that is even special-case, too.

	* fixed problem with CloseKeyboard() sometimes restoring flags
	that had never been read.  now, kbd_fd==-1 at startup, as it should.

	* fixed time problem - now DOS time is set properly at boot to be
	in sync w/Linux's clock.  After that, DOS can change it.

	* moved the port_[out,in] functions to emu.h

	* fixed a problem in get_leds() arising from the fact that &= is
	not the same operator as &. silly me.  now it works.

	* well, had to put ioperm()s to disable the emulator's I/O
	permissions before I re-enter the vm86() call. (of course, the
	vm86 "task" inherits the emulator's ioperms).  This means that if
	I'm not careful, I may leave an I/O port open to DOS :-(.

	* Added two options: -N exits the emulator before booting DOS (but
	after all the initialization), and -V allows VGA video.  This
	presently only includes the changing of the blink attribute bit to
	the high intensity background bit, but it will one day also enable
	VGA graphics.

	* the linux.exe problem was found: linux.exe will fail if there
	are more than 2 floppy drives defined.  i defaulted the number of
	floppies and hard drives to 2 each; this is changeable by the -H
	and -F options.

Thu Jan 21 21:10:06 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* filled the highscan[] table for all chars <= 0x80 (ASCII).  the
	rest are alt-chars (from a terminal's point of view, META at least).

	* note that the below change required that I no longer open
	/dev/tty, but use STDIN_FILENO and dup() that.  whatever that implies.

	* fixed the console-video/keyb code.  dosemu can now detect if you
	are on a console, and refuse to run if not.  it also retrieves the
	console number for future use. (very system-dependent checking of the
	major/minor numbers! this is dangerous! if dev_t changes from 16
	bits, this breaks.)  console_video console switching should now be
	completely safe, thanks to WAITACTIVE.  currently, it blocks until
	the dos console is current.  I might want to change this so that
	it just doesn't map it if the console isn't current--using
	GETSTATE (and wait for later acquire_vt() calls to do so.)]

	* made the int13 disk-sensing functions more sensible. also made
	the dp->tracks, dp->heads stuff orthogonal (for some reason,
	matthias had made exceptions for floppys??).  You can now
	format/unformat a floppy, as well as a floppy disk image. added a
	default CMOS type to the disk table struct.

Sat Jan 16 10:28:23 1993    (root at hrothgar)

	* fixed alt-numkey bug in termio.c.  for some reason, alt-numkey
	scancodes get bumped up by 0x76. also fixed alt-- and alt-=

	* can't find bug that causes repeated extended keystrokes to kill
	the emulator: to find it, run tv.com on some file, go the bottom,
	and press & hold pgdn.  bam, crash.

	* fixed int21h, ah=1,7,or 8 problem with extended keycodes;
          (was supposed to return 0 first, then scancode on next call).
