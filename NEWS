Version dosemu2-2.0pre7
=============
We have over 450 commits, mostly targeted on re-introducing and fixing
the features previously supported in dosemu1, and a couple of new ones.
Unfortunately we also have a few regressions.
Summary below.

* Reworks to SDL plugin. The HW-accelerated rendering is disabled by
  default, as well as the scaling filters. If you want to use HW-accelerated
  rendering, try $_SDL_swrend = (off). If you want scaling filters, use
  'dosemu -X'. We will try to improve the SDL support in future releases.
* New $_bootdrive option allows to boot from any drive, not only C.
* Support booting OpenDOS and some old versions of MS-DOS
* 2 new keyboard plugins implemented ("stdio" and "tty") to allow dumb
  terminal mode to work without slang library. Selectable with '-kt', '-ks'.
* VGA pass-through in text-mode console is now fully supported. Hope
  no one uses it though.
* Windows-3.1 support is fully re-introduced, and is actually much better
  than in dosemu1. We also provide the mouse driver for windows-3.1 that
  allows the use of the host's mouse pointer:
  https://github.com/stsp/win31-mouse-driver/tree/master/out
* Resurrected basic Windows-3.0 support.
* Foxpro support re-introduced.
* Fixes to SVGA/VESA modes. Support for some missing modes added.
* Many fixes to gfx remapper. The various annoying video artifacts
  should now be fixed.
* SB16 fixes to support sound on more games.
* Mouse copy/paste support is fully re-introduced.
* Net: IPX and packet driver are fully functional again.
* Lots of build system improvements. We have now the debian build support
  and "make uninstall".
* X fonts are resurrected and provided again.
* Many fixes and improvements: DPMI support is now much more reliable,
  x86 JIT is more reliable, many performance improvements.

Version dosemu2-2.0pre6
=============
We have around 500 commits since pre5 with the highlights below:

* KVM is now enabled by default on 64bit builds. A huge speed-up!
* SDL plugin now uses hardware-accelerated texture updates instead
  of the (slow) drawing surface
* virtual modem support is added
* serial port fifos now work again (were broken/unsupported in dosemu2
    but worked in dosemu1)
* DPMI context switching is rewritten for speed-up, using a new
  linux kernel extensions and the code from libtask and libpcl
* default DPMI memory size enlarged to 128Mb, which is enough for
  all known DOS programs
* new builtin command system.com is added that runs DOS commands
  specified via the unix env vars. Similar functionality in unix.com
  is kept for compatibility.
* DOSDRIVE_D var is removed. Use new DOSDRIVE_EXTRA variable.
* mouse driver got a huge overhaul for improved robustness in non-grab mode
* winos2 mouse extension is implemented for better support of the OS/2
  mouse driver under windows-3.1
* middle mouse button is now supported (was broken)
* dosdebug fixes
* many fixes to SDL plugin
* the home dir is no longer exposed to DOS by default. Use -home if you
  need this.
* added -cdrom option that tries to mount the cdrom and expose it to DOS
* $_hdimage option can now embed environment variables
* many performance bottlenecks were located and fixed
* many fixes and updates

Version dosemu2-2.0pre5
=============
* SDL video backend is now default, which means a GPU-accelerated rendering
* lredir command was deprecated, use lredir2 with the new syntax
* unix.com syntax was slightly changed
* new tool sound.com is added to change sound and MIDI parameters at run-time
* LPT2 is now pre-configured to print to PDF files
* Added preliminary support for old MS-DOSes (>=3.3) and some DR-DOSes
* many improvements to dosdebug
* use logarithmic volume scale for sound
* Preliminary KVM support - a very fast execution on 64bit machines.
  Should be manually enabled in config for now.
* Many regressions fixed
* Added valgrind support, which allowed to find many obscure bugs
* Work-arounds to support the newer fluidsynth for MIDI
* More versions of libao are supported for sound (each having its own bugs).
  This is good when SDL2 is unavailable.
* munt support for mt32 (you need to download Roland ROMs yourself)
* built-in backtracer is added for a better crash logs.
  Used if gdb is not installed.
* clang is now supported to compile dosemu2
