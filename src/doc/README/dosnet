<sect>Networking using DOSEmu
<p>
             A mini-HOWTO from Bart Hartgers 
<htmlurl url="mailto:barth@stack.nl" name="&lt;barth@stack.nl&gt;">
           ( for the detailed original description see below )

<sect1>The DOSNET virtual device.
<p>
Dosnet.o is a kernel module that implements a special virtual network
device. In combination with pktdrv.c and libpacket.c, this will
enable multiple dosemu sessions and the linux kernel to be on a virtual
network. Each has it's own network device and ethernet address.
<p>
This means that you can telnet or ftp from the dos-session to your
telnetd/ftpd running in linux and, with IP forwarding enabled in the 
kernel, connect to any host on your network.

<sect1>Setup for virtual TCP/IP
<p>
Go to ./src/dosext/net/v-net and make dosnet.o. As root, insmod
dosnet.o. Now as root, configure the dsn0 interface (for example: 
ifconfig dsn0 192.168.74.1 netmask 255.255.255.0), and add a route for it 
(for example: route add -net 192.168.74.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dsn0).
<p>
Finally, start dosemu, and give your TCP/IP client and ip-address in the
subnet you just configured. This address should be unique, i.e. no other
dosemu, or the kernel, should have this address. For the example addresses
given above, 192.168.74.2-192.168.74.254 would be good. Now you can use a
dos telnet client to telnet to your own machine!

          Allowing a program to have its own network protocol stacks. 
<p>
                 Resulting in multiple dosemu's to use
                      netware, ncsa telnet etc. 
<sect2>Introduction
<p>
     Allowing network access from dosemu is an important functionality.
For pc based network product developers, it will offer an easy development 
environment will full control over all the traffic without having to run 
around and use  several machines.  It will allow already available 
client-server based "front-ends" to run on dosemulator.  (Assuming that
they are all packet driver based -- as of now ;-) )
<p>
    To accomplish that, we require independent protocol stacks to coexist
along with linux' IP stack. One way is to add independent network card.
However, it is cumbersome and allows at most only 2-3 stacks. Other option
is to use the a virtual network device that will route the packets to
the actual stacks which run as user programs. 

<sect2>Design
   <p>
    Have a virtual device which provides  routing interface at one end
    (so it is a network device from linux side) and at other end, it
    sends/receives packets from/to user stacks. 
    <p>
    All the user stacks AND virtual device are virtually connected by
    a network (equavalent to a physical cable). Any broadcast packet 
    (sent by either user stack or router interface of the virtual
     device) should be sent to all the user stacks and router.
    All non-broadcast packets can be sent by communicating with
    each other.
<p>      
    Each user stack (here dosemu process) will have an base interface 
    which allows sending and receiving of packets. On the top of this,
    a proper interface (such as  packet driver interface) can be built.
    In dosemu, a packet driver interface is emulated.
<p>
    Every user stack will have a unique  virtual ethernet address.


<sect2>Implementation
<p>
    This package includes:
<enum>
       <item> dosnet module. Acts as virtual network device introducing
            'dsn0' interface.
            It provides usual network interface AND also facility to
            communicate with dosemu's. 

       <item> Modified  packet driver code (pktnew.c and libdosemu.c)
            to enable the above. Modifications include these:
<enum>
           <item> Generate an unique ethernet address for each dosemu .
                 I have used minor no. of the tty in use as part
                 of ethernet address. This works unless you start
                 two dosemu's in same tty.
            <item> Communication with dosnet device is done by opening 
                 a SOCK_PACKET socket of special type. 
</enum>              
       <item> IPX bridge code. Between eth0 and dsn0 so that multiple
            lan accesses can be made. 0.1 is non-intelligent.
            (both versions are alpha codes.)
            Actually IPX routing code is there in kernel.  Has anyone been 
            successful in using this?
	    Yet another alternative is to use IPTunnelling of IPX
	    packets (rfc 1234). Novell has NLMs for this on the netware
	    side. On linux, we should run a daemon implementing this
	    rfc.
</enum>

<sect2>Virtual device 'dsn0'
<p>
       Compile the module dosnet and insmod it, and give it an IP
       address, with a new IP network number. And You have to set up 
       proper routing tables on all machines you want to connect to. 
       So linux side interface is easy to set up.
<p>
       <em/Note:/ Some 3 kernel symbols are used by the module, which are not
       exported by kernel/ksyms.c in the kernel code. You could either
       add these symbols there, or use Hans' improved 'insmod'  (part of 
       syscall Manager package). (In that case, it will resolve the
       symbols from the zSystem.map file.
<p>
       This device is assigned a virtual ethernet address, defined in
       dosnet.h.  
<p>
       This device is usual loadable module. (Someone please check if
       it can be made more efficient.) However, what is interesting is
       the way it allows access to user stacks (i.e. dosemu's.) i.e.
       its media interface.
<p>
       A packet arrives to dosnet from linux for our virtual internal 
       network (after routing process). If it is broadcast packet, dosnet 
       should send it to all dosemu's/user stacks.  If it is normal
       packet, it should send it only particular user stack which has
       same destination ethernet address . 
<p>
       It performs this process by the following method, using SOCK_PACKET
       interface , (and not introducing new devices).: 
<p>
         The dosemu opens a SOCK_PACKET interface for type 'x' with the dosnet
         device. The result of this will be an addition of entry into
         type handler table for type 'x'.  This table stores the type and
         corresponding handler function  (called when a packet of this type 
         arrives.) 
<p>
         Each dosemu will open the interface with unique 'x'  .
<descrip>
        <tag/sending packets from dosemu to dosnet/
               SOCK_PACKET  allows you to send the packet "as is". 
               So not a problem at all.
        <tag/dosnet -&gt; dosemu/
               this is tricky. The packet is simply given by dosnet 
               device to upper layers. However, the upper layer calls
               function to find out the type of the packet which is
               device specific (default is eth_type_trans().). 
               This routine, which returns type of given packet, is to 
               be implemented in each device. So in dosnet, this plays
               a special role. If the packet is identified as 
               type 'x',  the upper layers (net/inet/dev.c) call the
               type handler for 'x'.
<p>
               Looking at destination ethernet address of a packet, we can say 
               deduct that it is packet for dosemu, and its type is
               'x' (i.e. 'x' is "inserted" in dosemu's virtual ethernet
               address.)  Type handler function for 'x' is essentially
               SOCK_PACKET receiver function which sends packet back to 
               dosemu.
<p>
               <em/NOTE:/ the "type" field is in destination ethernet address
               and not its usual place (which depends on frame type.) So
               the packet is left intact -- there is no wrapper function
               etc.  We should use type "x" which is unused by others;
               so the packet can carry _ANY_ protocol since the data 
               field is left untouched. 

        <tag/Broadcast packets/
		We use a common type "y" for dosnet
               broadcasts. Each dosemu "registers" for "y" along
               with usual "x" type packet using SOCK_PACKET. This
               "y" is same for all dosemu's.
               (The packet is duplicated  if  more than one SOCK_PACKET 
                asks for same type. )
</descrip>
<sect2> Packet driver code
<p>
               I have add the code for handling multiple protocols.
<p>
               When a packet arrives,  it arrives on  one of the two 
	       SOCK_PACKET handle we need to find out which of the 
	       registered protocols  should be handled this code. 
               (Earlier code opened multiple sockets, one for each IPX type.
		However it is not useful now because we use *any*
		type.) When a new type is registered, it is added to a
		Type list. When a new packet arrives, first we find out
		the frame type(and hence the position of type field in the 
		packet, and then try matching it with registered types.
		&lsqb; ----  I missed comparing class; I will add it later.&rsqb;
		Then call the helper corresponding to the handle of that
		type.
<p>
   Rob, you should help in the following:
<enum>
     <item> Packet driver code ... 
<p>
                We should now open only two sockets: one specific to dosemu and
                other broadcast. So we have to add code to demultiplex
                into packet types... I couldn't succeed. Even
                broadcast packets are not getting to dosemu.
     <item> Which virtual ethernet  addresses to use (officially)?
     <item> Which  special packet type can be used?
     <item> Kernel overhead .. lots of packet types getting introduced
          in type handler table... how to reduce?
</enum>

<sect2>Conclusion ..
<p>
So at last one can open multiple DOSEMU's and access network
from each of them ...  However, you HAVE TO set up ROUTING TABLES
etc.

<p>
I forgot to mention this: The kernel sources need to be patched
slightly. (This is happening with any new loadable module these days ;-)
Here is what you need to do:  The only file that gets affected is
kernel/ksyms.c in the linux sources:

After this, recompile the kernel. You should compile with "IP FORWARD" 
config option enabled (for allowing routing).
With this kernel, 'insmod dosnet' will work. After this step, 
'cat /proc/net/dev' should show this device.
<p>
After this it is admin stuff:
<p>
I run these commands: 144.16.112.1 is "special" address. 'dsn0' is the
new interface name.
<tscreen><verb>
ifconfig dsn0 144.16.112.1 broadcast 144.16.112.255 netmask 255.255.255.0
route add -net 144.16.112.0 dsn0
</verb></tscreen>

Compile dosemu with  new pktnew.c and libpacket.c sources (to be put in
net directory.) Start dosemu. You could start 'telbin 144.16.112.1' 
after assigning IP address (say 144.16.112.10) for the dosemu in CONFIG.TEL 
file. Each dosemu should get a new IP address. 


<sect3>Telnetting to other Systems
<p>
 Other systems need to have route to this
"new" network. The easiest way to do this is to have  static route for
dosnet IP network included in remote machine you want to connect to. 
After all tests are carried out, one could include them permanently 
(i.e. in gated configurations etc.). However, the "new" IP address should 
only be internal to your organisation, and not allowed to route outside. 
There is some rfc in this regard, I will let you know later.
For e.g., I am working on 144.16.98.20. Internal network I created was
144.16.112.0. (See the above route command.)
To connect to another linux system 144.16.98.26 from dosemu, I include
static route by running 'route add -net 144.16.112.0 gw 144.16.98.20'
on that system. It becomes more complex if you need to connect to 
outside of 144.16.98.0.

<sect3>Accessing Novell netware
<p>
   Since dosemu is now on "different device", IPX needs to be either
bridged or routed. If it is bridged, then there is no requirement for
any extra administration ; simply run 'ipxbridge' program supplied with
the dosnet sources. (There are two versions of it; 0.1 copies all
packets to from/to both interface. 0.2 is "intelligent bridge", it
copies packet to other interface only if the destination lies on other
interface. )
<p>
   If you instead want to use "routing" for IPX, then you need to
enable IPX config option in the kernel.  Next, you should select a
network number that won't clash with others. Set up static direct 
ipx routes in linux, and then in one Novell netware server which is 
directly connected (i.e. without any router inbetween.). (That is where
you should contact Novell sysadm's ;-) The idea is, the server acts as route 
broadcaster. (I haven't actually tested this; and we are working on getting 
proper daemons etc. which will make linux act as IPX router proper.) 
<p>
(You could include this info along with other documentation...)
<p>
Hope this helps,
<p>
Vinod.
<p>
I just realised one more thing: The ipxbridge-0.2 code assumes that
you have 'eth0' and 'eth1' as the two interfaces. And it uses this
fact while choosing the interface to put the packet. So it won't
recognise when 'dsn0' is used. 
<p>
ipxbridge-0.1 will work though.
<p>
Also, note that both these programs put the card in promiscuous mode.
<p>
So my suggestion is to "somehow" get IPX routing done by linux!
<p>
Vinod.
