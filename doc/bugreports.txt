1. Reporting Bugs in DOSEMU

   Featured in this release is an automatic BUG Reporting system.
   
   Simply run ./submit-bug-report and fill in as much information as you
   can about the bug. The system will automatically make copies of your
   /etc/dosemu.conf and your .dosrc (if you have one). It also allows you
   to include a file containing debug information.
   
   Please try to fill in as much detail as possible and select a suitable
   category as this will help us to trace and deal with the bug quickly.
   
   The default action is to save the report in a file which you can then
   send later or from another machine. [1] If you have a direct internet
   connection then the bug report can be sent straight away if you set
   the 'Report Action' to 'email'.
   
   You should recieve a response within about 24hrs confirming that the
   bug report has been recieved and details of who is tracking the bug.
   You will also be notified of our progress.
   
   If you have any problems then please get in touch!

   [1] You will probably need to edit the file before you can send it.
   Please try and preserve the headers as they are important. If you have
   access to another unix system then the best method for sending the
   file is to feed the file to '/usr/lib/sendmail -t'.
