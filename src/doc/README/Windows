<title>Running Windows under DOSEMU</title>

<para>
DOSEMU can run any 16bit Windows up to 3.1, and has limited
support for Windows 3.11. You should be able to install and run
these versions of Windows without any extra work. There are still
a few caveats however, and if you have some problems, read on.

<title>Mouse in Windows under DOSEMU</title>
<para>
When using Windows 3.1, the windows mouse cursor can get out of sync
with the mouse pointer of your X session. To solve this problem you
need to install an alternative mouse driver:

</ulink>
This archive contains the file pdmouse.drv, which you can simply
copy over the existing mouse.drv in your WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.
Alternatively you can use the install procedure documented in the
driver's ReadMeEN.txt file.

<title>Windows 3.x in SVGA modes</title>

<para>
If you want to run Windows in SVGA mode, you can either use the
Trident drivers, or the patched SVGA drivers of Windows 3.11.
</para>

<para>
The Trident drivers for Windows are in the files tvgaw31a.zip
and/or tvgaw31b.zip. Search www.winsite.com to get them.
Unpack the archive. In Windows setup, install the
Trident "800x600 256 color for 512K boards" driver.
</para>

<para>
Windows 3.11 comes with SVGA drivers. You can also download
them: search www.winsite.com for svga.exe and install the drivers.
Then go to
<ulink url="http://www.japheth.de/dwnload1.html">

</ulink>
and get the SVGAPatch tool. This tool causes the above drivers to
work with most of the video cards in a real DOS environment, and
makes them DOSEMU-compatible too.

<title>VxD support</title>
<para>
By the time of writing this, DOSEMU does not have support
for Windows ring-0 device drivers (.vxd, .386). Fortunately, most of
Windows 3.1 drivers are ring-3 ones (.drv), so you can easily
install the Sound Blaster drivers, for instance. This is not the
case with Windows 3.11. Its network drivers are ring-0 ones, so
the native Winsock does not work. In order to get networking
operational, you need to get the Trumpet Winsock package. Refer
to chapter "Using Windows and Winsock" for more info on this.

<title>DOS shell in Windows</title>
<para>
There is probably little use of a DOS shell under Windows under
DOSEMU... But for those who need it, here are some basic hints.
The DOS shell is supported by DOSEMU only if Windows is running in
Standard mode. The Enhanced mode DOS shell is currently unsupported.
Note however, that unlike in a real DOS environment, under DOSEMU
the DOS shell of the Windows in Standard mode allows you to run
protected mode applications (in the real DOS environment only the DOS shell
of the Enhanced mode allows this).
