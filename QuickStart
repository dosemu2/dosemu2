How to quickly get dosemu up and running:

1) Make a DOS bootable disk:
	- Boot DOS
	- Format a: /S
	- Copy fdisk.exe to the diskette
	- Copy sys.com to the diskette
2) Make dosemu:
	- Modify the Makefile if you need special keyboard, etc
	- Do make config
	- Do make dep
	- Do make install
	- Copy an edited examples/config.dist to /etc/dosemu/config
	- Copy exitemu.com from the commands subdirectory to the
	  diskette
	- Copy hdimage.dist to hdimage
3) Prepare DOSEMU:
	- From the dosemu0.49pl2 directory, type dos -A >/dev/null
	- From the a: drive do fdisk /mbr
	- From the a: drive do sys c:
	- type exitemu
4) Go for it:
	- type dos >/dev/null
	- From here you are on your own. Please read the documentation
	  in the doc subdirectory, and most of all ENJOY!!!!!

  Some notes from Tim Bird (Tim_R_Bird@Novell.COM) on lredir found
in the commands subdir :

LREDIR allows you to redirect any drive, including one that is
currently a physical drive, meaning that you can replace a drive with a
redirected one. When you delete the redirection, the physical drive is
again visible. I am currently using this so that the boot diskimage
disappears, and is replaced by the mounted MSDOS file system in Linux, 
with the drive letter and root the same as when I just boot DOS.  
People who use LREDIR in this way should be careful when they use 
LREDIR in the autoexec, because COMMAND.COM will continue parsing
the autoexec.bat from the redirected drive as the same file offset
where it left off in the autoexec.bat on the physical drive. For 
this reason, it is safest to have the autoexec.bat on the 
redirected drive and the physical drive (diskimage) be the same.
 
Notes:
 - Don't put more that 2 emufs.sys statements in your config.sys if
   you are running MS DOS. LREDIR them after the boot, maybe in your
   config.sys. DR. DOS accepts any number.
 - A mouse driver that works is mscmouse found on Simtel and the 
   mirrors.
 - Various reports have been received that showed DR.DOS is not up
   to 100% under emufs.sys. I'm thinking it's something invalid in
   the expected data area's used, but we have yet to track it down.
   If emufs.sys is not working correctly under DR.DOS for you, please
   send a debug into me after verifying that all's well when you do
   the same thing under MS.DOS. If MSDOS also exhibits the same the
   problems then I really want a debug output. Oh what the heck,
   send a debug output anyway :-).

Many thanks to all involved, including all those who submitted debug
output for my viewing pleasurei, keep it coming.
