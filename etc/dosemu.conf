## CPU settings: define the CPU features to DOSEMU.

# CPU shown to DOS, valid values:  "80[23456]86"
# Default: 80586

# $_cpu = "80586"

# Select cpu virtualization mode.
# "vm86" - use v86 mode via vm86() syscall. Only available on x86-32.
# "kvm" - use KVM, hardware-assisted in-kernel virtual machine.
# "emulated" - use CPU emulator
# "auto" - select whatever works
# Default: "auto"

# $_cpu_vm = "auto"

# Select cpu virtualization mode for DPMI.
# "native" - use native LDT via modify_ldt() syscall (Warning: INSECURE!)
# "kvm" - use KVM, hardware-assisted in-kernel virtual machine
# "emulated" - use CPU emulator
# "auto" - select whatever works
# Default: "auto"

# $_cpu_vm_dpmi = "auto"

# CPU emulation mode (if enabled).
# 0 - jit; 1 - interpreter
# jit is faster, interpreter is probably more compatible.
# Default: 0

# $_cpuemu = (0)

# if possible use Pentium cycle counter for timing. Default: off

# $_rdtsc = (off)

# CPU speed, used in conjunction with the TSC
# Default 0 = calibrated by dosemu, else given (e.g.166.666)

# $_cpuspeed = (0)

# emulated FPU, (off) or (on), default = (on)

## Disk and file system settings

# List of hdimages or directories under ~/.dosemu, or specified
# with an absolute path.
#
# For older versions of MS-DOS and PC-DOS you may want to limit the size of
# any directory-mode virtual disks, or the OS may fail to recognise them:
# /path/to/dir:hdtype1 - creates 10mb IBM type1 disk with C/H/S of 306/4/17
# /path/to/dir:hdtype2 - creates 21mb IBM type2 disk with C/H/S of 615/4/17
# /path/to/dir:hdtype9 - creates 117mb IBM type9 disk with C/H/S of 900/15/17
#
# You can reference the pre-defined path groups with '+' sing followed
# by the number of the group. Currently the following groups are defined:
#   Group 0: user's main drives. This group consists of just one path that
#     should normally be mapped to drive C. You can omit that group if you
#     want to map your own directory to drive C.
#   Group 1: utility/configs & boot drives. This group includes multiple
#     paths that you can map to any drive letters. This group provides the
#     boot files, dosemu-specific drivers and utilities, and the shell.
#   Group 2: utility/configs drive only. This is for non-default setups
#     where DOS was manually installed to drive C, and boot drives are
#     not needed.
# Warning: You need to map group 1 or the boot may fail.
#
# Example: "+0 drives/* +1" means assign group 0 path to drive C,
# then map the content of ~/.dosemu/drives, then map group 1 to
# the consecutive drive letters.
# dosemu1-compatible setup may look like "drives/*".
#
# Some drive letters can be skipped during boot, for example if you
# want to redirect them later. Use '-' sign followed by the amount
# of drive letters to skip.
# Example: "+0 -2 +1" means assign group 0 path to drive C, skip 2
# letters (D, E), then map group 1.
# Note that letter skipping only works correctly with fdpp.
#
# Folders can be mapped to drive letters using full paths.
# Example: "+0 /home/<USERNAME> drives/* -3 +1" means
# assign group 0 to drive C; assign your Home folder to drive D; 
# assign folders in ~/.dosemu/drives to drive letters (for example,
# ~/.dosemu/drives/drive_e and ~/.dosemu/drives/drive_f will be 
# E and F); skip 3 letters (G, H, I); map group 1 to J, K, and L.
#
# Default: "+0 +1" (map both groups of paths to the consecutive drives)

# $_hdimage = "+0 +1"

# Floppy drives.
# May be set up to directory or to /dev/fdX device node.
# Optionally the device type may be appended, such as
# "/dev/fd0:threeinch".
# A directory can be used as a read-only virtual floppy: "floppy_dir:threeinch",
# in which case $HOME/.dosemu/floppy_dir will be used as a floppy image.
# To boot from a floppy, use "boot" keyword, such as:
# $_floppy_a = "dos33.img:boot"
# Note that $_bootdrive overrides the floppy boot flag.
#
# Default: "/dev/fd0:threeinch" for A:, "" for B:

# $_floppy_a = "/dev/fd0:threeinch"
# $_floppy_b = ""

# select the boot drive
# Default: "" (which means auto, finds the first bootable drive)

# $_bootdrive = ""

# swap drives the way the bootdrive to become C
# Needed for DOSes that can't boot from anything other than C drive.
# Default: off

# $_swap_bootdrive = (off)

# List of CDROM devices. Up to 4 are supported. You may also specify
# image files. You need to load cdrom.sys and mscdex/nwcdex/shsucdx.exe.
# Default: "" (means auto, usually /dev/cdrom)

# $_cdrom = ""

# list of generic SCSI devices to make available for the builtin aspi driver

# Some dumb programs probe the file lock limit by applying locks
# in a loop and checking for an error. The unlimited amount of
# file locks causes such probe to loop infinitely.
# To avoid that, we set the maximum allowed locks number to 1024.

## Settings specific to SDL video driver (dosemu -S)

# Use GPU-assisted rendering.
# Default: off (we still have problems with HW acceleration)

# $_SDL_hwrend = (off)

# Comma-separated list of TTF fonts to use.
# Default: "Flexi IBM VGA9 False, Flexi IBM VGA9 True"

# $_SDL_fonts = "Flexi IBM VGA9 False, Flexi IBM VGA9 True"

## Direct hardware access

# NOTE: the settings below here that are marked [priv] are only valid in
# a system-wide dosemu.conf and cannot be changed by ~/.dosemurc.
# For these settings to take effect, DOSEMU must be run with root privileges;
# run it as root, via sudo, or suid with adjustments in dosemu.users,
# and using the -s switch.

# [priv] list of portnumbers such as "0x1ce 0x1cf 0x238" or
# "0x1ce range 0x280,0x29f 310" or "range 0x1a0,(0x1a0+15)". Default: ""
# $_ports = "device /dev/null fast 0x200"
# $_ports = $_ports, " device /dev/lp0 range 0x378 0x37a"
# The blank is important
# "device" means: if the ports are registered, open this device to block
# access. The open must be successful or access to the ports will be denied.
# If you know what you are doing, use /dev/null to fake a device to block

# $_ports = ""

# [priv] list of IRQ numbers (2-15) to pass to DOS such as "3 8 10".Default: ""
# This does not work on x86-64.

# $_irqpassing = ""

# [priv] DOS memory to map directly: list of segment values/ranges such as

# "0xc8000 range 0xcc000,0xcffff". Default: ""

# $_hardware_ram = ""

# [priv] (on): give access to the PCI configuration space.
# (auto): restricted, mostly emulated access if the video card requires it.
# Default: (auto)

# $_pci = (auto)

## Console video

# The following settings apply to direct console video only (not in X)
# Many are privileged, and need suid/sudo/root and the -s switch.

# use 'console' video (direct video ram access). Default:
# (auto) -- use only if KMS is not active

# $_console = (auto)

# use the cards BIOS to set graphics and allow direct port i/o. Default:
# (auto) -- use only if KMS is not active

# $_graphics = (auto)

# Video adapter style used: one of: vga, ega, mda, mga, cga, none
# Default: "vga"; none=dumb terminal mode.

# $_video = "vga"

# [priv] run the VGA card's initialization BIOS routine (most cards don't
# need this). Default: (0)

# $_vbios_post = (0)

# [priv] set the address of your VBIOS (e.g. 0xc000, 0xe000).
# Default: (0)=autodetect.

# $_vbios_seg = (0)

# [priv] set the size of your BIOS (e.g. 0x10000, 0x8000).

# Default: (0)=autodetect.

# $_vbios_size = (0)

# [priv] amount in K of (real) video RAM to save/restore
# when switching virtual consoles. (auto) means all video RAM,
# which can take *too* long if you have a lot of the video memory.
# (off) means no video RAM saving.
# Default: 4096

# $_vmemsize = (4096)

# [priv] real chipset: one of: plainvga, svgalib, vesa
# svgalib is available only if it is compiled in.
# "vesa" will probably work; if not, try "plainvga". Default: "vesa"

# $_chipset = "vesa"

# [priv] if you have one vga _plus_ one hgc (2 monitors)

# $_dualmon = (0)

##############################################################################
## Host permissions

# list of commands (by their full paths) allowed to execute via unix.com
# Example: "/bin/ls /bin/echo" will enable commands ls and echo.
# Default: "" (host execution not allowed)

# $_unix_exec = ""

# list of paths allowed to be redirected to DOS drives with lredir.com
# Note: sub-paths of the specified paths are allowed, too.
# Note: this does not affect $_hdimage setting or redirections activated
# with -d command-line switch.
# Example: "/home/user/dos/c /home/user/dos/d"
# Note: spaces in paths are not supported, sorry.
# Note: giving full access like "/" or "/home/user" is insecure.
# Default: "" (host redirections with lredir.com not allowed)

# $_lredir_paths = ""
