1. DOSEMU Configuration

   Running './setup-dosemu' from this directory will allow you to
   configure both the compilation and the run-time aspects of DOSEMU.
   When changing the run-time settings of DOSEMU you can set both the
   system wide settings and your personal settings. Even better, the
   program will automatically tell you your current settings or suggest
   defaults where possible.
   
   The program needs Tcl/Tk, take care to have it available on your
   system.
