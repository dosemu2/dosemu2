1. The preliminaries

1.1. What is dosemu, anyway?

   To quote the manual, "dosemu" is a user-level program which uses
   certain special features of the Linux kernel and the 80386 processor
   to run MS-DOS/FreeDOS/DR-DOS in what we in the biz call a `DOS box.'
   The DOS box, a combination of hardware and software trickery, has
   these capabilities:
   
     * the ability to virtualize all input/output and processor control
       instructions
     * the ability to support the word size and addressing modes of the
       iAPX86 processor family's "real mode," while still running within
       the full protected mode environment
     * the ability to trap all DOS and BIOS system calls and emulate such
       calls as are necessary for proper operation and good performance
     * the ability to simulate a hardware environment over which DOS
       programs are accustomed to having control.
     * the ability to provide DOS services through native Linux services;
       for example, dosemu can provide a virtual hard disk drive which is
       actually a Linux directory hierarchy."
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.2. What operating systems does dosemu work under ?

   Dosemu is primarily written for Linux. It also works on NetBSD and
   possibly FreeBSD, however the graphics emulation is unlikely to work
   on NetBSD, which means that all DOS programs that use graphics mode
   (most DOS programs) will not work under NetBSD.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.3. What processors does dosemu work on ?

   Dosemu only works on Intel 80x86 processors, e.g. 80386, 80486,
   Pentium etc.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.4. What if I have an Alpha/Sparc/Motorola/other non-Intel CPU ?

   Dosemu only works on Intel 80x86 processors but there are
   alternatives: Bochs (http://www.bochs.com) is an open source shareware
   PC emulator that runs on most Unixes (as well as MS-Windows), and
   there are other (non-free) alternatives - see the comp.emulators.misc
   FAQ, available via usenet or
   ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet-by-hierarchy/comp/emulators/misc/
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.5. Do I need MS-DOS to use dosemu ?

   No. You need some version of DOS but not necessarily MS-DOS. See the
   section "What versions of DOS are known to run with dosemu ?"
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.6. Can I run Microsoft Windows programs under dosemu ?

   Not reliably. You would be better to use the Windows emulator Wine
   (http://www.winehq.com). If you insist on running Windows under
   dosemu, see section 8 - dosemu and MS-Windows 3.1.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.7. I want to run something that won't run under DOSemu or Wine

   See section 1.4.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.8. Names and numbers

    (xx/yy/zz) means day zz in month yy in year xx.

    winemu mean WinOS/2 running in dosemu.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.9. What version of Dosemu should I use?

   Dosemu uses the same numbering scheme as the kernel. Uneven second
   numbers are for possible unstable developer releases, even second
   numbers are for releases considered stable. At the time of writing,
   1.0.0 is the latest stable release, while 1.1.0 is the latest
   developer's release. So if you want to use dosemu, get the latest
   stable release.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.10. What's the newest version of dosemu and where can I get it?

   The newest version of dosemu as of 2000/02/28 is dosemu-1.0.0 and can
   be ftp'ed from:
    ftp://ftp.dosemu.org/pub/dosemu/

   We just decided to leave BETA stage, however: there may be serious
   bugs and very little documentation for new features. The development
   version is particularly likely to have bugs. Please use it only if you
   like to do active development. Don't report bugs in the development
   version, fix them instead.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.11. Where can I ask questions?

   If you have problems regarding installing and running dosemu after
   reading the documentation, first try to help yourself: Your question
   has probably been asked and perhaps answered before. Try some search
   engine on the internet to retrieve that information. E.g. you can ask
    http://www.dejanews.com

   to find all newsnet articles containing the keywords of your question.
   Helping yourself will probably be faster than asking a well known
   question. It also frees up the time of developers from answering
   trivial question and so helps the further development of dosemu.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.12. Where can I report bugs and ask questions?

   If you want to ask questions and report bugs regarding dosemu, you
   should consider subscribing to the linux-msdos mailing list. To
   subscribe, send mail to Majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu with the following
   command in the body of your email message:
    subscribe linux-msdos your_username@your.email.address

   If you ever want to remove yourself from the mailing list, you can
   send mail to Majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu with the following command in
   the body of your email message:
    unsubscribe linux-msdos your_username@your.email.address

   (95/8/11). When you are subscribed to linux-msdos, you can send your
   report as mail to linux-msdos@vger.rutgers.edu. There is a gate that
   send mails to linux-msdos@vger.rutgers.edu as postings to the
   newsgroup named linux.dev.msdos. If your News provider doesn't carry
   that group, ask her(him) to add that group. Before you ask a question,
   you should carefully read all of the documentation, including this
   HOWTO and check one of the mailing list archives listed at
   http://www.dosemu.org/mailinglist.html to see whether your question
   has already been asked and answered.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.13. What documentation is available for dosemu?

   Dosemu comes with documentation. The main documentation files
   README.txt and README-tech.txt cover virtually all aspects of dosemu
   and may be more up-to-date than this HOWTO.
   
   The "dosemu Novice's Altering Guide" or DANG is a road map to the
   inner workings of dosemu. It is designed for the adventurous, those
   who wish to modify the source code themselves. The DANG is maintained
   by Alistair MacDonald (alistair@slitesys.demon.co.uk) and is found in
   the doc directory of the dosemu source tree.
   
   The EMU failure list (EMUfailure.txt) is a partial list of programs
   known not to work under dosemu.
   
   And then, of course, there is the dosemu FAQ/HOWTO. But you already
   know about that, don't you. It is also posted once in a while to the
   mailing list and found in the doc-directory. The most recent version
   can be found at http://www.dosemu.org.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.14. I have a program that fails, not listed in EMUfailure.txt

   First check, if the failure of your program is not caused by some of
   the fundamental incapabilities of dosemu, listed in EMUfailure.txt. If
   you think you have something new, please report to
   linux-msdos@vger.rutgers.edu. Perhaps it can be made going with the
   help others. Give detailed information about your setup, tell the
   version of kernel, dosemu etc and name the observed errors. You can
   use xdos to cut and paste the error message into your report. But keep
   your report in a readable form. We know the content of
   ../etc/config.dist. So only send the active lines from your
   dosemu.conf. Try running dosemu with some or all debug output turned
   on and scan through your debug output and at first only send those
   parts you think are relevant. Few people are willing to decode some
   long attachment to a mail, to do debugging for others. But keep your
   logs at hand, in case others ask detailed questions.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.15. How do I submit changes or additions to the HOWTO?

   The preferred method is to edit the file dosemu-HOWTO-xx.x.sgml to
   incorporate the changes, create a diff file by typing something like
   
    diff -uw original-file new-file

   and send it to davidhodges@altavista.iname.com. If you do not know
   SGML, that's ok. Changes or new information in any form will be
   accepted. Creating the diff file just makes it easier on the HOWTO
   maintainer. :-)

2. Compiling and installing dosemu

2.1. Where are the installation instructions?

   The installation instructions are in the file, "QuickStart", included
   in the distribution.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.2. Top ten problems while compiling and installing dosemu.

   1. Forgetting to read the QuickStart Guide.
   
   2. Try to compile some old version of dosemu.
   
   3. Try to compile with a kernel older than 2.0.28 or 2.1.15.
   
   4. Having the wrong linux kernel source sitting in /usr/src/linux or
   missing /usr/src/linux/include/version.h
   
   5. Use dosemu with a kernel that does not have IPC compiled in.
   
   6. Compile with gcc older than 2.7.2 or libc older than 5.x.x.
   
   7. Forget to edit your /etc/dosemu.conf, /etc/dosemu.users and
   /var/lib/dosemu/global.conf files
   
   8. Run DOSEMU with partition access while they are already mounted.
   
   9. Don't install dosemu with sufficient privileges (i.e., root).
   
   10. Try to run programs that use DPMI without enabling dpmi in
   /etc/dosemu.conf
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.3. How do I make aout binaries?

   Starting with version 0.64.4 there is no a.out support any more. If
   you absolutely need it, you must use version 0.64.3.1. The configure
   script then should take care for this, if you setup is a standard
   setup.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.4. How do I compile dosemu on a machine with low memory?

   Marty Leisner (leisner@sdsp.mc.xerox.com) reported (95/4/8) that
   
   If you have problems with running out of swap space you may want to
   add CFLAGS+=-fno-inline after CFLAGS is defined in dpmi/Makefile. Be
   careful before you do this and check for the existence of swap space.
   I found Linux crashes at times when it has no swap space.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.5. Compilation fails with some strange error regarding "slang"

   You probably have
    slangforce off

   in your compiletime-settings file. You need to change it to
    slangforce on

   and recompile.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.6. What configurable options are available ?

   The compiletime-settings.help file describes the options you can
   change at compile time. The README.txt file describes the options you
   can change at run time.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.7. Do I need to run dosemu as root?

   No. Although dosemu drops root privilege wherever possible, it is
   still safer to not run dosemu as root, especially if you run DPMI
   programs under dosemu. Most normal DOS applications don't need dosemu
   to run as root, especially if you run dosemu under X. Thus you should
   not allow users to run a suid root copy of dosemu, wherever possible,
   but only a non-suid copy. You can configure this on a per-user basis
   using the /etc/dosemu.users file.
   
   Programs that require direct access to hardware ports (e.g. if the
   program needs to talk to some unusual hardware that is not supported
   by Linux and dosemu) require dosemu to run as root but printers,
   serial ports, mice and video cards (and to a small extent sound -
   hopefully more soon) are emulated by dosemu so you don't need direct
   hardware access and don't need to run as root to use these.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.8. How do I patch dosemu ?

   If you do patch dosemu from one version to another, do "make
   pristine;./configure; make". If you don't make pristine, at least the
   version of the new executable will be wrong, if the whole thing
   compiles at all(97/2/9).
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.9. What versions of DOS are known to run with dosemu ?

   All versions of DOS should work with dosemu, with the following
   caveats:
   
   FreeDOS (http://www.freedos.org) does not (yet) have a working
   redirector so you will not be able to access your Linux filesystem or
   Novell networking under FreeDOS. Note also that FreeDOS is unreliable
   beta software and may crash unexpectedly, trash its filesystem, etc.
   etc.
   
   DOS 4.01 had problems by itself, so it won't work reliably with dosemu
   either.
   
   With MsDos-7 aka Win95 you must not start the graphic shell at bootup.
   If you make the hdimage bootable with the so called "Rescue Disk" you
   are offered to make during the Windows installation, you get the right
   settings. If you use your normal Win95 installation to transfer the
   system files, have a look at the msdos.sys written on the hdimage and
   change the settings under the section [Options] to have entries like
    [Options]
    Logo=0
    BootGUI=0
     _________________________________________________________________
   
3. Hard disk setup

3.1. How do I use my hard disk with dosemu?

   First, mount your dos hard disk partition as a Linux subdirectory. For
   example, you could create a directory in Linux such as /dos (mkdir -m
   755 /dos) and add a line like
    /dev/hda1       /dos     msdos   umask=022

   to your /etc/fstab. (In this example, the partition is mounted
   read-only. You may want to mount it read/write by replacing "022" with
   "000" and using the -m 777 option with mkdir). Now mount /dos.
   
   The README.txt says:
   
   you just can have a Linux directory containing all what you want to
   have under your DOS C:. Copy your IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS or what ever to
   that directory (e.g. /var/lib/dosemu/bootdir), put
   
    $_hdimage = "bootdir"

   into your /etc/dosemu.conf, and up it goes. DOSEMU makes a lredir'ed
   drive out of it and can boot from it. You can edit the config.sys and
   the autoexec.bat within this directory before you start dosemu. Fur-
   ther more, you may have a more sohisticated setup. Given you want to
   run the same DOS drive as you normal have when booting into native
   DOS, then you just mount you DOS partition under Linux (say to /dos)
   and put links to its subdirectories into the boot dir. This way you
   can decide which files/directories have to be visible under DOSEMU and
   which have to be different. Here's a small and incomplete example
   bootdir setup:
   
    config.sys
    autoexec.bat
    command.com -> /dos/command.com
    io.sys -> /dos/io.sys
    msdos.sys -> /dos/msdos.sys
    dos -> /dos/dos
    bc -> /dos/bc
    windows -> /dos/windows

   There is, however, one drawback, you can't use the DosC kernel
   (FreeDos) for it, because it hasn't yet a working redirector (will
   hopefully be available some time in the future).
     _________________________________________________________________
   
3.2. How can I access the hdimage from Linux?

   Use mtools. With a line in /etc/mtools.conf like
    drive n:  file="/var/lib/dosemu/hdimage" MTOOLS_SKIP_CHECK=1 \
    MTOOLS_LOWER_CASE=1 MTOOLS_NO_VFAT=1 partition=1 offset=128

   you can use the mtools on the hdimage, like "mdir n:". "mcopy
   n:/config.emu /tmp" copies the config.emu file from the hdimage to
   /tmp/config.emu. You can edit it there and copy it back. Use a drive
   letter you find sensible. "N:" is only an example.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
3.3. Can I use my stacked/double-spaced/super-stored disk?

   At this time, compressed drives cannot be accessed via the redirector
   (lredir or emufs) on a standard kernel. There is a patch for the
   kernel to mount compressed files under the name "dmsdosfs". Find it on
   sunsite.unc.edu and its mirrors
    http://sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/dosfs/

   A good idea is also to look in
   http://sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/Incoming for a newer version. The
   "wholedisk" option in older versions of dosemu is no longer allowed in
   recent versions, however, a line like
    $_hdimage = "/dev/hda1"

   may work, at the risk that you could lose all data in that partition
   on a dosemu crash.
   
   If your dos partition is already mounted with write access and you try
   to run dosemu with partition access, dosemu will print a warning
   message and abort. This prevents DOS and Linux from making independent
   writes to your disk and trashing the data on your dos
   partition(95/8/11).
   
   ---------------------
   
   If LILO is installed, the above will not work. However...
   
   Thomas Mockridge (thomas@aztec.co.za) reported (94/8/5) that
   
   To boot dosemu with LILO and Stacker 4.0 I did a little work around...
   
   1. dd the MBR to a file. (or norton utility, etc., first 512 bytes)
   
   2. Boot dos (from full boot not emu), do a fdisk /mbr, make your dos
   partition active with (dos) fdisk.
   
   3. Copy the new MBR to a file.
   
   4. Replace the original MBR
   
   5. Copy the second MBR to /var/lib/dosemu/partition.hda? (Whichever is
   your dos partition)
   
   6. Set dosemu.conf
   
    disk {partition "/dev/hda? ?"}

   7. Start dosemu and and voila! No LILO.
   
   For recent versions of dosemu you need to change the
   
    disk {partition "/dev/hda? ?"}

   line to something like
   
    $_hdimage = "/dev/hda1"

   ---------------------
   
   Holger Schemel (q99492@pbhrzx.uni-paderborn.de) reported (94/2/10)
   that
   
   Works even fine under dosemu with MS-DOS 6.0. If you have problems,
   then you have to edit the file `DBLSPACE.INI' manually and change the
   disk letter to the letter your drive gets under dosemu.
   
   ---------------------
   
   Darren J Moffat (moffatd@dcs.gla.ac.uk) also reported (94/3/27)
   
   "...use 6.2 if you can get it!! Just make sure you have a LILO boot
   disk on hand since dos 6{.2} will change the MBR of the boot HZ."
     _________________________________________________________________
   
3.4. Creating your own hdimage file.

   The easy way is to use mkdexe - see README.txt for details. The
   old-fashioned way (I don't know why anyone would want to do it that
   way any more but here it is, just in case) is as follows:
   
   There is an extra util program called mkfatimage16 which allows for
   creating a hdimage file headers. The full information is in the
   manpage (man/mkfatimage16.1) included in your distribution.
   
   To create a hard disk image file with a geometry corresponding to that
   of a real hard disk of 32 megabytes run:
    mkfatimage16 -k 32768 > hdimage

   This is probably too large for most needs; if you need this much
   space, consider using the disk redirector."
   
   Usually it is a good idea to format the drive after it.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
4. Parallel ports, serial ports and mice

4.1. Port access worked with older version, but doesn't work now!

   Read ../doc/README.txt and the port-section in ../etc/config.dist
     _________________________________________________________________
   
4.2. Port access was faster with older versions!

   To have a chance to log port access, by default every port access
   produces an exception out of vm86-mode. This takes some time. If you
   don't want to log port access, use the keyword "fast" in the
   appropriate port statement.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
4.3. Where are the (microsoft compatible) mouse drivers?

   Tom Kimball (tk@pssparc2.oc.com) reported (93/11/24) that
   
   Several people said to use a different mouse driver and suggested
   some. I found a couple that seem to work fine.
    oak.oakland.edu:/pub/msdos/mouse/mouse701.zip   (mscmouse)
    oak.oakland.edu:/pub/msdos/mouse/gmous102.zip   (gmouse)

   Normally you can use dosemu's internaldriver, so you don't need any
   additional mousedriver in dosemu outside winemu(97/2/10).
     _________________________________________________________________
   
4.4. Why doesn't the mouse driver work?

   Mark Rejhon (mdrejhon@magi.com) reported (95/4/7) that
   
   If you start the mouse driver and it just hangs (it might actually
   take 30-60s), but if you are waiting longer than a minute for the
   mouse driver to start, try specifying the COM port that the mouse is
   on, at the mouse driver command line.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
4.5. Why does dosemu clobber COM4?

   Rob Janssen (rob@pe1chl.ampr.org) reported (94/3/24) that
   
   According to jmorriso@bogomips.ee.ubc.ca, "dosemu still clobbers COM4
   (0x2e8, IRQ 5). 0x2e8 isn't in ports{} in config. I have to run
   setserial /dev/cua3 irq 5 on it after dosemu exits."
   
   This is caused by your VGA BIOS. I have found that by enabling the IO
   port trace and seeing where it was clobbered.
   
   Disable the "allowvideoportaccess on" line in config and it will work
   fine. When you then have problems with the video, try to enable more
   selective ranges of IO addresses (e.g., 40-43).
     _________________________________________________________________
   
4.6. How do I use dosemu over the serial ports?
     _________________________________________________________________
   
4.7. How can I switch between dosemu and a shell over the serial line?

   John Taylor (taylor@pollux.cs.uga.edu) reported (94/5/25) that
   
   I am running Linux 1.1.13 and want to point out a great feature that
   should be protected and not taken out (IMHO). With the 52 version, I
   can run the program, "screen." From screen, i can invoke dos -D-a.
   What is really great (IMHO) is the screen commands (the CTRL-A cmds)
   still work. This means I can do a CTRL-A C and add another unix shell,
   and switch between the two (DOS / UNIX). This allows me to use dosemu
   over the serial line really well, because switching is made easy.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
4.8. How can I get the parallel ports to work?

   The dosemu.conf has lines at the end to redirect printers to either
   lpr or a file. If you want direct access to the bare metal, comment
   out these emulation lines, and add the line
    $_ports { device /dev/lp0 fast range 0x3bc 0x3bf  } # lpt0

   for the "monitor card" printer port (corresponds to /dev/lp0), or
    $_ports { device /dev/lp1 fast range 0x378 0x37f } # lpt1

   or
    $_ports { device /dev/lp1 fast range 0x278 0x27f } # lpt2

   for LPT1 (/dev/lp1) or LPT2 (/dev/lp2) respectively(97/2/9).
   
   Hans Lermen (lermen@dosemu.org) writes:
   
   But NOTE: these lines should not be _added_ simply, the string should
   be concatenated such as:
    $_ports = "...."
    $_ports = $_ports, " device /dev/lp0 fast range 0x3bc 0x3bf"
    =
    This blank is important
     _________________________________________________________________
   
5. Multiple users and Non-interactive sessions

5.1. Can I use dosemu on a multi-user system?

   Yes, you can configure dosemu on a per-user basis. See README.txt for
   details.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
5.2. How can I run dos commands non-interactively?

   You can do any of the following: 1. redirect a file to dosemu standard
   input 2. use the keystroke configuration option and the -I command
   line option as described in the README.txt file to specify keystrokes
   on the command line that will act exactly as if you had typed them
   within dosemu 3. use the mkdexe program to create a DEXE file - a
   small DOS filesystem image containing just the program you want to run
   - see the README.txt file for details.
   
   Here are some additional alternatives:
   
   Daniel T. Schwager (danny@dragon.s.bawue.de) reported (94/7/2) that
   
   You can use different dosemu.conf files (and different hd-boot-images
   with different autoexec.bat's) and call dosemu like
    $ dos -F my_quicken_q_exe_dosemu.conf

   ---------------------
   
   Dietmar Braun (braun@math20.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de) reported
   (94/7/4) that
   
   This is no problem at all when you use the redirector of dosemu. It is
   possible to redirect a drive letter to a linux path given by an
   environment variable.
   
   So I have a shell script named "DOS" which does something like
    mkdir /tmp/dos.$$
    DOSTMP=/tmp/dos.$$; export DOSTMP

   and then a little trick to get "echo $* > $DOSTMP/startup.bat" really
   working (actually a small C Program which turns `/' in `\' and
   terminates lines correctly for messy dos with cr/lf pairs and adds ^Z
   at the end of the file), creates startup files, links and so on in
   this directory, and then starts dosemu. Within "autoexec.bat" drive c:
   is redirected from hdimage to this tmp-directory, which has links for
   $HOME and $PWD.
   
   So if I want to see my filenames shortened to 8.3 I can type "DOS dir"
   and I get my current directory listing. So I have full DOS multi user
   (I don't have any DOS partition and redirecting to Linux preserves
   user permissions) and multi tasking. (dosemu sessions are completely
   independent). I did this once to be able to use a dos driver for my
   printer. My printcap df is actually a DOS program. So you can even
   make DOS executables act as lpr filters.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
6. dosemu and Netware

6.1. How do I get Netware access from dosemu?

   As always, access through the Linux filesystem is preferred. Mount
   your Netware drives with Caldera's Netware utilities or Volker
   Lendecke's free ncpfs utility
   (ftp://ftp.gwdg.de:/pub/linux/misc/ncpfs). If you need real IPX
   access, e.g. to run Novell's "syscon", read ../doc/NOVELL-HOWTO.txt.
   You probably can not currently access Netware from FreeDOS.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
7. dosemu and X-windows(97/2/9).

7.1. Can I run dosemu in console mode while running X?

   Ronald Schalk (R.Schalk@uci.kun.nl) reported (94/1/17) that
   
   Yes, no problem. Just remember to use ctrl-alt-<Fn> to go to a Virtual
   Console (VC), and you can run any Linux application (dosemu is a
   linux-application). I've got almost always WP5.1 in a dos session.
   
   [Note: Use ctrl-alt-F7 to switch back to X from dosemu, if X runs on
   VC7.]
     _________________________________________________________________
   
7.2. Is it possible to run dosemu in a window in X-windows?

   If you have X installed and you have successfully compiled dosemu and
   run it successfully outside X-windows, you should be able to run
   "xdos" or "dos -X" right away to bring up a dosemu window. If this
   does not work, make sure:
   
    1. Dosemu has X support compiled in. This is default, however
    if you you have compiled dosemu with "x off" in the
    compiletime-settings file you don't have X support. So changing
    "x off" to "x on" in the compiletime-settings file, followed by
    "make pristine; make; make install" should build
    you a dosemu-executable with X support, if you have the
    X-libraries installed in /usr/X11R6.
    2. Set up your X key-mappings.  In an xterm, type
    xmodmap -e "keycode 22 = 0xff08"
    xmodmap -e "keycode 107 = 0xffff"
    These lines fix the backspace and delete keys respectively.
    3. Configure the X-related configuration options in your
    /etc/dosemu.conf file.

   Alternatively, you can run dosemu inside a color xterm, which is not
   recommended because many color xterms have buggy support for the
   complex text display capabilities of dosemu. This does not require
   X_SUPPORT to be compiled into dosemu. However, if you really want to
   do this, do the following steps:
   
    1. Install ansi_xterm.  The recommended package is available as:
    tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/ALPHA/dosemu/Development/ansi-xterm-R6.tar.gz
    2. Set up your X key-mappings.  In an xterm, type
    xmodmap -e "keycode 22 = 0xff08"
    xmodmap -e "keycode 107 = 0xffff"
    These lines fix the backspace and delete keys, respectively.
    3. Configure the terminal-related (not X-related) settings in
    /etc/dosemu.conf

   Marty Leisner (leisner@sdsp.mc.xerox.com) reported (95/3/31) that
   
   I have xrdb log the following resources
    dosxterm*Font:  vga
    dosxterm*geometry:      80x25
    dosxterm*saveLines: 25

   or I alias "dosxterm" to "term -fn vga -title dosxterm -geometry 80x25
   -sl 25"
   
   If you use the xrdb method, all you have to do is run "xterm -name
   dosxterm"
     _________________________________________________________________
   
7.3. Xdos dosen't work on a remote X-display!

   At present, dosemu is set up to use the MIT shared memory extensions.
   This extension only works on a local display. If you want to run xdos
   on a remote display, compile dosemu with "mitshm off" in the
   compiletime-settings file after a "make pristine" or on the clean
   source tree(97/2/9).
     _________________________________________________________________
   
7.4. Xdos dosen't find the VGA font

   Check that the vga fonts you installed are listed in the font.dir of
   the directory you installed the fonts in:
    hertz:~> grep misc /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config
    FontPath    "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"
    hertz:~> grep vga /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/fonts.dir
    vga.pcf vga
    vga11x19.pcf vga11x19
    hertz:~> ls /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/vga*
    /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/vga.pcf
    /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/vga11x19.bdf
    /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/vga11x19.pcf


   If you installed some X-fonts, like you did when you installed dosemu
   with X-Support for the first time, "mkfontdir" and then "xset fp
   rehash" needs to be run. The dosemu install should take care for
   "mkfontdir" and tells you about "xset fp rehash". Tell us if it
   doesn't work for you. (97/2/13)
     _________________________________________________________________
   
7.5. The vga font is very small on my high resolution display

   Look for the vga11x19 font. (97/2/13)
     _________________________________________________________________
   
7.6. Dosemu compilation fails with some strange error regarding X!

   As stated above, dosemu uses the MIT shared memory extensions by
   default. Under XFree86 they are only available with Version 3.1.2 and
   above. If you have an older version, consider to upgrade, or configure
   dosemu to not use this extension (see last section)(97/2/9).
     _________________________________________________________________
   
7.7. Does ansi emulation work properly?

   Marty Leisner (leisner@sdsp.mc.xerox.com) reported (95/3/31) that
   
   Yes. I use nnansi.com under X windows. I find 25, 43 and 50 line mode
   work properly, however 50 line mode is difficult to use on a 1024x768
   screen (unless smaller fonts are used or you use a bigger screen. 43
   line mode will resize the xterm window to use 43 lines.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
8. dosemu and MS-Windows 3.1

8.1. Is it possible to run MS-Windows 3.1 under dosemu?

   The ../doc/README.Windows file says:
   
    ***************************************************************
    *    WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!   *

    ***************************************************************

   Okay, it is possible to boot WINOS2 (the modified version of Windows
   3.1 that OS/2 uses) under DOSEMU. Many kudos to Lutz & Dong!
   
   However, YOU NEED BOTH LICENSES, for WINDOWS-3.1 as well OS/2 !!!
   
   There are many known problems. Windows is prone to crash, could take
   data with it, large programs will not load, etc. etc. etc. In other
   words, it is NOT ready for daily use. Many video cards are known to
   have problems (you may see a nice white screen, however, look below
   for win31-in-xdos). Your program groups are all likely to disappear.
   ... Basically, it's a pain.
   
   for more details see the README.txt file.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
8.2. Can I run 32bit stuff with winemu

   Sorry, no you can't. Win32s needs stuff running in ring 0. That's a
   "nono" with linux. (97/04/27)
     _________________________________________________________________
   
8.3. Errormessage: Cannot find the vdtapi.386 file when starting dosemu

   As explained above, winemu can't handle 32 bit stuff. All drivers
   ending in 386 are 32bit. So to run winemu, you have to delete all
   references to .386 drivers in your win.ini. (97/04/27)
     _________________________________________________________________
   
8.4. Windows 3.x in xdos:

   As of version 0.64.3 DOSEMU is able to run Windows in xdos. Of course,
   this is not recommended at all, but if you really want to try, it is
   safer then starting windows-31 on the console, because _when_ it
   crashes, it doesn't block your keyboard or freeze your screen.
   
   Hints:
    1. Get Dosemu & Linux source.
    2. Unpack dosemu.
    3. Run "./configure" to configure Dosemu (it will enable vm86plus as a
    default).
    4. Type "make" to compile.
    5. Get a Trident SVGA drivers for Windows. The files are tvgaw31a.zip
    and/or tvgaw31b.zip. They are available at garbo.uwasa.fi in
    /windows/drivers (any mirrors?).
    6. Unpack the Trident drivers.
    7. In Windows setup, install the Trident "800x600 256 color for 512K
    boards" driver.
    8. Do the things described above to get and install OS2WIN31.
    10. Start xdos.
    11. In Dosemu, go to windows directory and start winemu.
    12. Cross your fingers.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
8.5. Can I install windows from within dosemu?

   No you can't. Dos will tell you something like
    The XMS driver you have on your system is not
    compatible with Windows...

   You need to install windows from Dos. You can copy the windows tree to
   somewhere on your Linux Filesystem and use lredir to mount it on the
   same place as it is in dos. Example:
    You have windows in d:\windows
    You have d:\ mounted as /dosc in Linux
    You copy the windows tree to Linux,
    e.g. "cp -a /dosd/windows /usr/share
    Inside dosemu you redirect the copied tree like
    lredir d: linux\fs\dosd

   Now dosemu can't mess around in you windows directory, but changes in
   the windows directory aren't seen by dosemu too. If you want to do the
   same with windows on drive c:> look in this FAQ how to redirect c:.
   
   But you can use "setup" from inside the windows directory to install
   drivers and change some settings. (97/2/1497)
     _________________________________________________________________
   
8.6. Notes for the mouse under win31-in-xdos:

   1. Use the mouse driver "mouse.drv" from WinOS2
   
   2. In order to let the mouse properly work you need the following in
   your win.ini file:
    [windows]
    MouseThreshold1=0
    MouseThreshold2=0
    MouseSpeed=0

   3. The mouse cursor gets not painted by X, but by windows itself, so
   it depends on the refresh rate how often it gets updated, though the
   mouse coordinates movement itself will not get delayed. ( In fact you
   have 2 cursors, but the X-cursor is given an `invisible' cursor shape
   while within the DOS-Box. )
   
   4. Because the coordinates passed to windows are interpreted
   relatively, we need to calibrate the cursor. This is done
   automatically whenever you enter the DOS-Box window: The cursor gets
   forced to 0,0 and then back to its right coordinates. Hence, if you
   want to re-calibrate the cursor, just move the cursor outside and then
   inside the DOS-Box again. (97/2/10)

8.7. Why did my Icon disappear from the Program manager?

   MS-Windows and WinOS2 handle the program manager group differently.
   While MS-Win store the setup in progman.ini, WinOS2 wants the contents
   of progman.ini in system.ini. Here's a tip from (friest@acm.org (Todd
   T. Fries)):
    cat progman.ini >> system.ini

   Be sure to use >> :-)

9. Video and sound

9.1. Can I run 32-bit video games under dosemu?

   Mark Rejhon (mdrejhon@magi.com) reported (95/4/8) that
   
   With the recent DPMI improvements that has gone into 0.60, you can now
   run some 32-bit video games in dosemu. If the game is compatible in an
   OS/2 DOS box, there are chances that it will work in dosemu. (Example
   32-bit games include Descent, Dark Forces, Mortal Kombat 2, Rise of
   The Triad, which have all successfully been tested in recent dosemu
   releases).
   
   Before you attempt to run a video game, you must have the keyboard
   configured in raw keyboard mode and enabled VGA graphics modes, in the
   /etc/dosemu.conf file.
   
   Note, however, you will have to turn off the sound in the game.
   (Someone will have to program in sound board emulation before we can
   avoid this). Note that game timers can be a little bit slow, due to
   Linux multitasking and lack of high-frequency timer support. So the
   games may run from anywhere from 5 to 100 percent speed. Typically,
   the speed is approximately 50 percent in recent dosemu releases and is
   expected to improve eventually.
   
   Who knows, it might even work. If you can't get it to work, check
   EMUfailure.txt if the program is listed there, or falls in a category
   of programs that at present don't or probably never work with dosemu.
   If you think, it should be listed in EMUfailure.txt, report to
   linux-msdos@vger.rutgers.edu
   
   There is a security hole when having enabled DPMI and having dosemu
   suid root (especially when using dos4gw-based games), the client is
   able to access the whole user space, hence also can modify the dosemu
   code itself. Use of the `secure' option in /etc/dosemu.conf, e.g.
    $_secure = "ngd" # secure for: n (normal users), g (guest), d (dexe)

   disables this. It is better to run dosemu as a normal user under X
   rather than root anyway.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
9.2. Exiting from dosemu gives me a screen full of garbage.

   (95/4/8)
   
   The problem is that the font information for the VGA text screen is
   not being saved. Get a copy of the svgalib package. The current source
   is in
    sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/libs/graphics/svgalib-1.3.1.tar.gz

   It may also be available as a pre-compiled package in your favorite
   Linux distribution (e.g., Slackware, etc.). Use savetextmode to save
   the current text mode and font to a file in /tmp before running
   dosemu. Then run textmode upon exiting dosemu to restore it.
   
   Addition from (lermen@elserv.ffm.fgan.de(97/2/11)):
   
   Have a look also at src/arch/linux/debugger/README.recover and
   README.dosdebug, dosdebug can aid you recovering.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
9.3. Why doesn't my soundcard software work with dosemu?

   Dosemu includes a rudimentary soundblaster emulator called SBemu - the
   documentation for it is currently at
   http://www.slitesys.demon.co.uk/a.macdonald/dosemu/sound/ This is a
   work in progress, not completed yet so much or most DOS software that
   uses sound will not work correctly with it yet.

10. Games

10.1. Duke3d dosen't work

   Hans Lermen <lermen@elserv.ffm.fgan.de> said (97/2/16): duke3d must be
   `configured' via a setup, within this setup you have to choose
   `keyboard + mouse', else it won't work.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
11. Problems and fixes

11.1. Security issues

   A full featured Dosemu needs to be suid root, e.g to access ports.
   Most dos programs don't need this however so when running under X you
   usually do not need to run dosemu as root. Dosemu runs as suid "root"
   only where it is needed, and releases this right thereafter. But with
   DPMI, the Dos client programm can access the whole user space, hence
   also can modify the dosemu code itself. Use of the `secure' option in
   /etc/dosemu.conf disables this. There are several other important
   security considerations discussed in the Security section of the
   README.txt file.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
11.2. dosemu says "ERROR: general protection" and terminates when I run some
program

   This will happen if your program uses DPMI and you do not have DPMI
   enabled. Try changing the line
    $_dpmi = (off)

   in /etc/dosemu.conf to
    $_dpmi = (nnnn)

   where nnnn is the number of kilobytes of memory you wish to give to
   the DOS program (e.g. Doom requires about 4000 kilobytes). If you do
   this, you should not run dosemu as root (see the Security Issues
   section) - it is better not to run dosemu as root whenever possible,
   in any case.
   
   Another likely cause is that your program uses VCPI (see
   EMUfailure.txt for more details) or some other means of switching to
   protected mode (other than DPMI), in which case it will never work
   under dosemu.
   
   If none of these is the case, see section 1.14 I have a program that
   fails, not listed in EMUfailure.txt.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
11.3. Dosemu dies when booting. I have Win95 installed.

   Dosemu relies that the Dos-Version on the hdimage and the Drive you
   map to contain command.com are the same. If not, dosemu will crash
   sooner or later. With the dual boot option Win95 offers when pressing
   the F4,F5 and F8 Keys with the "Starting Win95" text, versions on the
   Win95 drive may swap. Take special care for command.com. Let your
   shell variable in config.emu point to the correct static version of
   command.com, e.g.: shell=c:\win95\command.com c:\ /P /E:1024
   (97/02/28)
     _________________________________________________________________
   
11.4. Dosemu hangs! How can I kill it?

   Switch to another console and type dosdebug, then type kill (it may
   take a while but will work eventually).
     _________________________________________________________________
   
11.5. Dosemu crashed and now I can't type anything.

   Daniel Barlow(jo95004@sable.ox.ac.uk) reported (95/4/8) that
   
   If you have no terminal or network access that you can use to log in,
   you may have to press the reset button. If you can still get a usable
   shell somehow, run "kbd_mode -a" to switch the keyboard out of raw
   mode, and/or "stty sane" on the console so that you can see what
   you're typing.
   
   A useful thing to do is to use a script to run dosemu, and run
   "kbd_mode -a" automatically right after dosemu. When dosemu crashes,
   the script usually will resume running, and execute the "kbd_mode -a"
   command.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
11.6. I've enabled EMS memory in dosemu.conf but it does not help.

   Rob Janssen (rob@pe1chl.ampr.org) reported (94/7/11)
   
   Don't forget to load the provided ems.sys from the config.sys file.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
11.7. How do I get rid of all those annoying "disk change" messages?

   (94/8/11)
   
   Grab and install klogd. Try
    sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Daemons/sysklogd1.2.tgz
     _________________________________________________________________
   
11.8. Why won't dosemu run a second time after exiting in console mode?

   Aldy Hernandez (aldy@sauron.cc.andrews.edu) reported (94/7/8) that
   
   You should disable your video and/or BIOS caching.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
11.9. Why will dosemu run in a term but not in the console?

   JyiJiin Luo (jjluo@casbah.acns.nwu.edu) reported (94/4/19) that
   
   I experienced exactly the same problem before. I figured out all the
   video shadow in my AMI BIOS must be disabled. Now dosemu runs fine on
   my system.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
11.10. How can I speed up dosemu?

   In some cases it is useful to play with the value of the HogThreshold
   variable in your dosemu.conf file.
   
   Daniel Barlow(jo95004@sable.ox.ac.uk) reported (95/4/8) that
   
   HogThreshold should now be set to approximately half of the BogoMips
   value that the system reports on boot.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
11.11. My CDROM drive has problems reading some files under dosemu.

   Vinod G Kulkarni (vinod@cse.iitb.ernet.in) reported (94/4/7) that
   
   When a CDROM is mounted from linux and used from within dosemu (mapped
   drive), there could be some problems. The CD-ROM driver (iso9660) in
   the kernel tries to find out the type of the file (i.e. binary or
   text). If it can't find, it tries to guess the type of the file using
   a heuristic. This heuristic fails under some circumstances when a
   (almost) text file is to be treated as binary. (I do not know if it is
   a bug or feature.)
   
   The result of this is that if you copy such a file from CD-ROM (from
   linux itself, and not necessarily dosemu), the resulting file will be
   usually bigger than original file. (Blanks get added before ^J,^M.) So
   a program running in dosemu gives an error or hangs, which may be
   mistaken as problem of dosemu.
   
   Rob Janssen (pe1chl@rabo.nl) reported (94/8/10) that
   
   The way to solve this is to turn off conversion altogether. Pass the
   option "-o conv=binary" to the mount command mounting the CD-ROM, or
   use the following in /etc/fstab:
    /dev/cdrom  /cdrom          iso9660 conv=binary,ro

   No patches to the kernel are necessary.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
11.12. How do I see debugging output?

   Daniel Barlow(jo95004@sable.ox.ac.uk) reported (95/4/8) that
   
   As of dosemu 0.60, debugging output is redirected to a file specified
   on the command line. Use "dos -D+a -o /tmp/debug" to log all debug
   output to /tmp/debug. There should no longer be any need to redirect
   stderr.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
11.13. Why are my keystrokes echoed ttwwiiccee??

   Nick Holloway (alfie@dcs.warwick.ac.uk) reported (94/2/22) that
   
   After running dos after playing with some stty settings, I was getting
   doubled key presses. I can now reveal what the reason is!
   
   It only happens when dos is run on the console with `istrip' set. This
   is (I think) because the raw scancodes are mutilated by the `istrip',
   so that key release events look like key press events.
   
   So, the input processing needs to be turned off when using the scan
   codes on a console (it wouldn't be a good idea to do it for tty
   lines).
     _________________________________________________________________
   
11.14. Dosemu scrambles my screen?

   For those graphics cards not fully supported in dosemu, with allowed
   console graphics a dosemu crash may leave your console in a scrambles
   and nearly unusable way. To prepare for that situation, Spudgun
   <spudgun@earthlight.co.nz> posted the following solution. First save
   your registers when running on the console ~> cat
   /usr/bin/savetextmode ~> restoretextmode -w /etc/textregs ~>
   restorefont -w /etc/fontdata Then, when a crash happened, run
   following script: restoretextmode -r /etc/textregs restorefont -r
   /etc/fontdata restorepalette
   
   If it doesn't fix it nothing will I also found having an X server
   running sometimes put my Vid card's registers into a strange state
   where this script made things worse I think since changing X servers
   and/or running savetextmode on a vt while X was running helped.

11.15. MS FoxPro 2.6 won't run

   FoxPro 2.6 doesn't run on network drives. Alexey Naidyonov
   <growler@growler.tsu.tula.ru> states on that problem: And I guess your
   FoxPro files are on lredir'ed disk, yeah? The matter is that FoxPro
   doesn't run on such disk, but when I said disk { partition ... } in
   /etc/dosemu/conf, it runs.
